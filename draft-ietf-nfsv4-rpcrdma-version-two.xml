<section
 title="Introduction"
 anchor="section:72f6ba4a-aafb-4e9d-8b87-800ebccc5879">
<t>
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
<xref target="RFC5040"/>
<xref target="RFC5041"/>
<xref target="IB"/>
is a technique for moving data efficiently between end nodes.
By directing data into destination buffers as it is sent
on a network and placing it using direct memory access
implemented by hardware,
the complementary benefits of
faster transfers
and
reduced host overhead
are obtained.
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 enables ONC RPC
<xref target="RFC5531"/>
messages to be conveyed on RDMA transports.
That protocol is specified in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 is deployed and in use,
although there are known shortcomings to this protocol:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The protocol's default size of Receive buffers forces
the use of RDMA Read and Write transfers for small payloads,
and limits the size of reverse direction messages.
</t>
<t>
It is difficult to make optimizations or protocol fixes
that require changes to on-the-wire behavior.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
To address these issues in a way that interoperates
with existing RPC-over-RDMA version 1 deployments,
a second version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol
is presented in this document.
</t>
<t>
Version 2 of RPC-over-RDMA is extensible,
enabling OPTIONAL extensions to be added
without impacting existing implementations.
To enable protocol extension,
the XDR definition for RPC-over-RDMA version 2 is
organized differently than the definition version 1.
These changes, which are discussed in
<xref target="section:d945b9f0-0666-4db7-9126-be57cf7b5f4f"/>,
do not affect the on-the-wire format.
</t>
<t>
In addition, RPC-over-RDMA version 2 contains
a set of incremental changes that relieve certain
performance constraints and enable recovery from
abnormal corner cases.
These changes are outlined in
<xref target="section:c2574344-5aec-427d-a5ed-048d7fcc0d95"/>.
</t>

<section
 title="Terminology"
 anchor="section:4DC39C9C-3770-491F-B674-F824E87E2143">
<t>
Because of the way in which RPC-over-RDMA version 2
builds upon the facilities present in RPC-over-RDMA version 1,
a knowledge of the basic structure of RPC-over-RDMA version 1,
as described in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>,
is assumed in this document,
especially Section 2.
</t>
<t>
The terms "RPC Payload Stream" and "Transport Header Stream" were originally
defined in Section 3.2 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
The RPC Payload Stream is an XDR stream containing an RPC message as defined by [RFC5531].
The Transport Header Stream is an XDR stream containing data items that
describe the RPC message payload
and its associated memory resources.
In that regard, the reader is assumed to understand
how RDMA is used to transfer chunks between client and server
and
the role of DDP-eligibility in constraining how data payloads are to be conveyed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",

<section
 title="RPC-over-RDMA Version 2 Flow Control"
 anchor="section:88b2fc9e-5fea-4195-bc6e-00a37ba116ef">
<t>
Because RPC-over-RDMA requires reliable and in-order delivery
of data payloads,
RPC-over-RDMA transports MUST use
the RDMA RC (Reliable Connected) Queue Pair (QP) type,
which handles recovery from packet loss or misordering.
RPC-over-RDMA transports, however, do need to provide
a flow control mechanism to prevent a sender
from overwhelming receiver resources.
RPC-over-RDMA transports employ
an end-to-end credit-based flow control mechanism
for this purpose.
[cel: citation needed for what a credit-based flow control mechanism is].
</t>

<section
 title="Granting Credits"
 anchor="section:278fca6a-f2a8-42f3-a4e9-a8d4b217567e">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 can support fully asymmetrical operation,
where a message in one direction might be matched by zero, one, or multiple
messages in the other direction.
To achieve this,
credits are assigned to each connection peer's posted Receive buffers.
Each requester has a set of Receive credits, and
each responder has a set of Receive credits.
These values are managed independently of each other.
</t>


<t>
Section 7 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
requires that the 32-bit field containing the credit grant is the
third word in the transport header.
To conform with that requirement,
the two independent credit values are encoded into a single
32-bit field in the fixed portion of the transport header.
After the field is XDR decoded, the receiver takes the low-order
two bytes as the number of credits that are newly granted by the sender,
and
the high-order two bytes as the maximum number of credits that
can be outstanding at the sender.
</t>
<t>
In this approach, then, there are requester credits,
sent in messages from the requester to the responder;
and responder credits,
sent in messages from the responder to the requester.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Asynchronous Credit Grants"
 anchor="section:f6348562-97f8-4413-96d7-bde3ff57b375">
<t>
A protocol convention is provided to enable one peer
to refresh its credit grant to the other peer
without sending a data payload.
Messages of this type can also act as a keep-alive ping.
See
<xref target="section:1c401555-4b7d-4e35-a9a3-8aa14228170e"/>
for information about this convention.
</t>
<t>
To prevent transport deadlock,
receivers MUST always be in a position to receive one such
credit grant update message, in addition to payload-bearing messages.
One way a receiver can do this is to post one extra Receive more than
the credit value it granted.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Transport Properties"
 anchor="section:86248e99-ca60-478a-8aff-3fb387410077">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides a mechanism
for connection endpoints
to communicate information about implementation properties,
enabling compatible endpoints to optimize data transfer.
Initially only a small set of transport properties are defined
and a single operation is provided to exchange transport properties
(see
<xref target="section:07e8c178-62df-46a7-a57e-dcf107821d93"/>).
</t>
<t>
Both the set of transport properties and the operations used to
communicate may be extended.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2, all such extensions are OPTIONAL.
For information about existing transport properties, see Sections
<xref

For discussion of extensions to the set of transport properties, see
<xref target="section:a355adad-f03b-41a6-94a8-4128b10301bb"/>.
</t>

<section
 title="Transport Properties Model"
 anchor="section:d5ac12f6-6735-48f3-b4ba-b44a19ff9298">
<t>
A basic set of receiver and sender properties is specified in this document.
An extensible approach is used, allowing new properties to be defined
in future Standards Track documents.
</t>
<t>
Such properties are specified using:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A code point identifying the particular transport property being specified.
</t>
<t>
A nominally opaque array which contains within it the XDR encoding
of the specific property indicated by the associated code point.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The following XDR types are used by operations that deal with
transport properties:
<figure align="left">
<artwork xml:space="preserve" align="left">
&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

typedef rpcrdma2_propid uint32;

struct rpcrdma2_propval {
        rpcrdma2_propid rdma_which;
        opaque          rdma_data&lt;&gt;;
};

typedef rpcrdma2_propval rpcrdma2_propset&lt;&gt;;

typedef uint32 rpcrdma2_propsubset&lt;&gt;;

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
An rpcrdma2_propid specifies a particular transport property.
In order to facilitate XDR extension of the set of properties
by concatenating XDR definition files,
specific properties are defined as const values
rather than as elements in an enum.
</t>
<t>
An rpcrdma2_propval specifies a value of a particular transport
property with the particular property identified by rdma_which,
while the associated value of that property is contained within rdma_data.
</t>
<t>
An rdma_data field which is of zero length is interpreted as
indicating the default value or the property indicated by rdma_which.
</t>
<t>
While rdma_data is defined as opaque within the XDR,
the contents are interpreted (except when of length zero)
using the XDR typedef associated with the property specified by rdma_which.
As a result, when rpcrdma2_propval does not conform to that typedef,
the receiver is REQUIRED to return the error RDMA2_ERR_BAD_XDR
using the header type RDMA2_ERROR as described in
<xref target="section:b1d23e5c-31df-483f-adb7-25430b5de38d"/>.
For example, the receiver of a message
containing a valid rpcrdma2_propval returns this error
if the length of rdma_data is such that it extends beyond
the bounds of the message being transferred.
</t>
<t>
In cases in which the rpcrdma2_propid specified by rdma_which is
understood by the receiver, the receiver also MUST report the error
RDMA2_ERR_BAD_XDR if either of the following occur:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The nominally opaque data within rdma_data is not valid when
interpreted using the property-associated typedef.
</t>
<t>
The length of rdma_data is insufficient to contain the data
represented by the property-associated typedef.
</t>
</list>
Note that no error is to be reported if rdma_which is unknown to the receiver.
In that case, that rpcrdma2_propval is not processed and processing continues
using the next rpcrdma2_propval, if any.
</t>
<t>
A rpcrdma2_propset specifies a set of transport properties.
No particular ordering of the rpcrdma2_propval items within it is imposed.
</t>
<t>
A rpcrdma2_propsubset identifies a subset of the properties in a
previously specified rpcrdma2_propset.
Each bit in the mask denotes a particular element in a previously
specified rpcrdma2_propset.
If a particular rpcrdma2_propval is at position N in the array,
then bit number N mod 32 in word N div 32 specifies whether
that particular rpcrdma2_propval is included in the defined subset.
Words beyond the last one specified are treated as containing zero.

Most RPC-over-RDMA version 2 data structures are derived
from corresponding structures in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
As is typical for new versions of an existing protocol,
the XDR data structures have new names and there are a
few small changes in content.
In some cases,
there have been structural re-organizations to enabled
protocol extensibility.

RPC-over-RDMA version 2's use of these first four words
matches that of version 1 as required by
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
However, there are important structural differences
in the way that these words are described
by the respective XDR descriptions:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The header type is represented as a uint32 rather than as an enum
that would need to be modified to reflect additions to the set of
header types made by later extensions.

<t>
The header type field is part of an XDR structure devoted to
representing the transport header prefix,
rather than being part of a discriminated union,
that includes the body of each transport header type.

<t>
There is now a prefix structure
(see
<xref target="section:2d1735f0-c465-43c6-9c18-3da6b7979862"/>)
of which the rpcrdma_common structure is the initial segment.
This is a newly defined XDR object within the protocol description,
in contrast with RPC-over-RDMA version 1, which limits the common
portion of all header types to the four words in rpcrdma_common.
</t>

These changes are part of a larger structural change
in the XDR description of RPC-over-RDMA version 2
that enables a cleaner treatment of protocol extension.
The XDR appearing in

The other bits are reserved for future use as described in
<xref target="section:15c76685-a24d-4799-bc8a-311d03ac3510"/>.

The RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE flag qualifies the value contained in the
transport header's rdma_start.rdma_xid field.
The RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE flag enables a receiver to reliably avoid
performing an XID lookup on incoming reverse direction Call messages.
</t>
<t>
In general, when a message carries an XID that was generated
by the message's receiver
(that is, the receiver is acting as a requester),
the message's sender sets the RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE flag.
Otherwise that flag is clear.
For example:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
When the rdma_start.rdma_htype field has the value RDMA2_MSG or
RDMA2_NOMSG, the value of the RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE flag MUST be the
same as the value of the associated RPC message's msg_type field.
</t>
<t>
When the header type is anything else
and
a whole or partial RPC message payload is present,
the value of the RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE flag MUST be the same
as the value of the associated RPC message's msg_type field.
</t>
<t>
When no RPC message payload is present,
a requester MUST set the value of RPCRDMA2_F_RESPONSE
to reflect how the receiver is to interpret the
rdma_start.rdma_xid field.

The RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag signifies that
the RPC-over-RDMA message payload continues in the next message.
This is referred to as Message Continuation, or Send chaining.
</t>
<t>
When the RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag is asserted,
the receiver is to concatenate the data payload of the next
received message to the end of the data payload of the
current received message.
The sender clears the RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag in the final
message means in the sequence.
</t>
<t>
If a peer receives an RPC-over-RDMA message
where the RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag is set
and
the rdma_start.rdma_htype field does not contain
RDMA2_MSG or RDMA2_CONNPROP,
the receiver MUST respond with
an RDMA2_ERROR message with the rdma_err field set to RDMA2_ERR_INVAL_FLAG.
</t>
<t>
When the RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag is set in an individual message,
that message's chunk lists MUST be empty.
Chunks for a chained message may be conveyed in the final
message in the sequence,
whose RPCRDMA2_F_MORE flag is clear.
</t>
<t>
There is no protocol-defined limit
on the number of concatenated messages in a sequence.
If the sender exhausts the receiver's credit grant before
the final message is sent,
the sender MUST wait for a further credit grant from
the receiver before continuing to send messages.
</t>
<t>
Credit exhaustion can occur at the receiver
in the middle of a sequence of continued messages.
To enable the sender to continue sending
the remaining messages in the sequence,
the receiver can grant more credits by
sending an RPC message payload
or
an out-of-band credit grant

A responder MUST use Message Continuation

rdma_header structures is the rdma_inv_handle field.
This field supports remote invalidation
of requester memory registrations
via the RDMA Send With Invalidate operation.
</t>
<t>
To request Remote Invalidation, a requester sets the value of the
rdma_inv_handle field in an RPC Call's transport header to a non-zero
value that matches one of the rdma_handle fields in that header.  If
none of the rdma_handle values in the header conveying the Call may
be invalidated by the responder, the requester sets the RPC Call's
rdma_inv_handle field to the value zero.
</t>

If the responder chooses not to use remote invalidation for this
particular RPC Reply, or the RPC Call's rdma_inv_handle field
contains the value zero, the responder uses RDMA Send to transmit the
matching RPC reply.

If a requester has provided a non-zero value in the RPC Call's
rdma_inv_handle field and the responder chooses to use Remote
Invalidation for the matching RPC Reply, the responder uses RDMA Send
With Invalidate to transmit that RPC reply, and uses the value in the
corresponding Call's rdma_inv_handle field to construct the Send With
Invalidate Work Request.

To simplify interoperability with RPC-over-RDMA version 1,

RDMA2_NOMSG can convey an entire RPC message payload using explicit RDMA operations.
When an RPC message payload is present, this message type is also known as a Long message.
In particular, it is a Long call
when the responder reads the RPC payload from a memory area specified by a Position Zero Read chunk;
and it is a Long reply
when the respond writes the RPC payload into a memory area specified by a Reply chunk.
In both of these cases, the rdma_xid field is set to the same value
as the xid of the RPC message payload.
</t>
<t>
If all the chunk lists are empty
(i.e., three 32-bit zeroes in the chunk list fields),
the message conveys a credit grant refresh.
The header prefix of this message contains a credit grant refresh
in the rdma_credit field.
In this case, the sender MUST set the rdma_xid field to zero.

All relevant transport properties that the sender is aware of should

Given that fact, the sender should make sure that the message
can be received by peers who use the default Receive Buffer Size.
The connection's initial receive buffer size is typically 1KB,
but it depends on the initial connection state of the RPC-over-RDMA
version in use.
</t>
<t>
Properties not included in rdma_props are to be treated by the peer
endpoint as having the default value and are not allowed to change
subsequently.
The peer should not request changes in such properties.
</t>
<t>
Those receiving an RDMA2_CONNPROP may encounter properties that they
do not support or are unaware of.
In such cases, these properties are simply ignored
without any error response being generated.

An XDR description of the structures that are generally available
for use by transport header types including both those defined in
this document and those that may be defined as extensions.
This includes definitions of the chunk-related structures

 title="Extraction and Use of XDR Definitions"
 anchor="section:a288b3e6-5e73-412d-91e8-f87c031cb05b">
<t>
The reader can apply the following sed script to this
document to produce a machine-readable XDR description of
the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol without any OPTIONAL
extensions.
<figure align="left">
<artwork xml:space="preserve" align="left">
&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

sed -n -e 's:^ */// ::p' -e 's:^ *///$::p'

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
That is, if this document is in a file called
"spec.txt" then the reader can do the following to extract
an XDR description file and store it in the file rpcrdma-v2.x.
<figure align="left">
<artwork xml:space="preserve" align="left">
&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

sed -n -e 's:^ */// ::p' -e 's:^ *///$::p' \
     &lt; spec.txt &gt; rpcrdma-v2.x

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Although this file is a usable description of the base protocol,
when extensions are to supported, it may be desirable to divide into
multiple files.
The following script can be used for that purpose:
<figure align="left">
<artwork xml:space="preserve" align="left">
&lt;CODE BEGINS&gt;

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
open(IN,"rpcrdma-v2.x");
open(OUT,"&gt;temp.x");
while(&lt;IN&gt;)
{
  if (m/FILE ENDS: (.*)$/)
    {
      close(OUT);
      rename("temp.x", $1);
      open(OUT,"&gt;temp.x");
    }
    else
    {
      print OUT $_;
    }
}
close(IN);
close(OUT);

&lt;CODE ENDS&gt;
</artwork>
</figure>
</t>
<t>
Running the above script will result in two files:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The file common.x, containing the license plus the common XDR
definitions which need to be made available to both the base
operations and any subsequent extensions.
</t>
<t>
The file baseops.x containing the XDR definitions for the base
operations, defined in this document.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Optional extensions to RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
published as Standards Track documents,
will have similar means of providing XDR that describes
those extensions.
Once XDR for all desired extensions is also extracted,
it can be appended to the XDR description file extracted
from this document to produce a consolidated XDR description
file reflecting all extensions selected for an RPC-over-RDMA
implementation.
</t>
<t>
Alternatively, the XDR descriptions can be compiled separately.
In this case the combination of common.x and baseops.x serves to
define the base transport, while using as XDR descriptions for
extensions, the XDR from the document defining that extension,
together with the file common.x, obtained from this document.

<section
 title="Use of the XDR Description Files"
 anchor="section:5541f0da-efbb-4431-af9c-6f82aa773963">
<t>
The three files common.x and baseops.x,
when combined with the XDR descriptions for extension defined later,
produce a human-readable and compilable description
of the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol with the included extensions.
</t>
<t>
Although this XDR description can be useful in generating code
to encode and decode the transport and payload streams,
there are elements of the structure of RPC-over-RDMA version 2
which are not expressible within the XDR language as currently defined.
This requires implementations that use the output of the XDR processor
to provide additional code to bridge the gaps.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The values of transport properties are represented
within XDR as opaque values.
However, the actual structures of each
of the properties are represented by XDR typedefs,
with the selection of the appropriate typedef described by text in
this document.
The determination of the appropriate typedef is not specified by XDR,
which does not possess the facilities necessary for that determination
to be specified in an extensible way.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
This is similar to the way in which NFSv4 attributes are handled
<xref target="RFC7530"/>
<xref target="RFC5661"/>.
As in that case, implementations that need to encode and decode
these nominally opaque entities need to use the protocol description
to determine the actual XDR representation that underlays the
items described as opaque.
</t>
<t>
The transport stream is not represented as a single XDR object.
Instead, the header prefix is described by one XDR object  while
the rest of the header is described as another XDR object with
the mapping between the header type in the header prefix and the
XDR object representing the header type represented by tables
contained in this document, with additional mappings being
specifiable by a later extension document.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
This situation is similar to that in which RPC message headers
contain program and procedure numbers, so that the XDR for
those request and replies can be used to encode and decode the
associated messages without requiring that all be present in a
single XDR specification.
As in that case, implementations need to use the header specification
to select the appropriate XDR-generated code to be used
in message processing.
</t>
<t>
The relationship between the transport stream and the payload
stream is not specified in the XDR itself,
although comments within the XDR text make clear
where transported messages, described by their own XDR, need to appear.
Such data by its nature is opaque to the transport,
although its form differs XDR opaque arrays.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
Potential extensions allowing continuation of RPC messages
across transport message boundaries will require that message
assembly facilities, not specifiable within XDR, also be part
of transport implementations.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
To summarize, the role of XDR in this specification
is more limited than for protocols which are themselves XDR programs,
where the totality of the protocol is expressible within the
XDR paradigm established for that purpose.
This more limited role reflects the fact that XDR lacks facilities
to represent the embedding of transported material
within the transport framework.
In addition, the need to cleanly accommodate extensions
has meant that those using rpcgen in their applications
need to take a more active role in providing the facilities that
cannot be expressed within XDR.

<section
 title="Protocol Version Negotiation"
 anchor="section:86d76c8e-8954-40dc-b94c-8fb7fa9ec86f">
<t>
When an RPC-over-RDMA version 2 client establishes a
connection to a server, its first order of business is to
determine the server's highest supported protocol version.
</t>
<t>
As with RPC-over-RDMA version 1,
upon connection establishment a client
MUST NOT send more than a single RPC-over-RDMA message at a
time until it receives a valid non-error RPC-over-RDMA message
from the server that grants client credits.
</t>
<t>
The second word of each transport header is used to convey
the transport protocol version.
In the interest of simplicity, we refer to that word as
rdma_vers even though in the RPC-over-RDMA version 2
XDR definition it is described as rdma_start.rdma_vers.
</t>
<t>
First, the client sends a single valid RPC-over-RDMA message
with the value two (2) in the rdma_vers field.
Because the server might support only RPC-over-RDMA
version 1, this initial message can be no larger than the
version 1 default inline threshold of 1024 bytes.
</t>

<section
 title="Server Does Support RPC-over-RDMA Version 2"
 anchor="section:8db4c54e-c1ce-43ba-93b4-031e829960f5">
<t>
If the server does support RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
it sends RPC-over-RDMA messages back to the client
with the value two (2) in the rdma_vers field.
Both peers may use the default inline threshold value
for RPC-over-RDMA version 2 connections (4096 bytes).
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Server Does Not Support RPC-over-RDMA Version 2"
 anchor="section:bedc4e66-4295-4dd6-8ac9-dd06907a08ad">
<t>
If the server does not support RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
it MUST send an RPC-over-RDMA message to the client with the
same XID, with RDMA2_ERROR in the rdma_start.rdma_htype field,
and with the error code RDMA2_ERR_VERS.
This message also reports a range of protocol versions that
the server supports.
To continue operation, the client selects a protocol
version in the range of server-supported versions for
subsequent messages on this connection.
</t>
<t>
If the connection is lost immediately after an
RDMA2_ERROR / RDMA2_ERR_VERS message is received,
a client can avoid a possible version negotiation loop
when re-establishing another connection by assuming
that particular server does not support RPC-over-RDMA version 2.
A client can assume the same situation (no server support
for RPC-over-RDMA version 2) if the initial negotiation message
is lost or dropped.
Once the negotiation exchange is complete,
both peers may use the default inline threshold value
for the transport protocol version that has been selected.

 title="Client Does Not Support RPC-over-RDMA Version 2"
 anchor="section:1ffe4c69-b516-476a-bba7-41863709f48d">
<t>
If the server supports the RPC-over-RDMA protocol version
used in Call messages from a client,
it MUST send Replies with the same RPC-over-RDMA protocol version
that the client uses to send its Calls.
The client MUST NOT change the version during the duration of the connection.

 anchor="section:3B0E673B-98D7-436D-BD6F-180180503DF6">
<t>
Like other fields that appear in each RPC-over-RDMA header,
property information is sent in the clear on the fabric
with no integrity protection, making it vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks.
</t>
<t>
For example, if a man-in-the-middle were to change the value of
the Receive buffer size or the Requester Remote Invalidation boolean,
it could reduce connection performance or trigger loss of connection.
Repeated connection loss can impact performance or even prevent a
new connection from being established. Recourse is to deploy on a

<section
 title="ULB Specifications"
 anchor="section:9e003b83-66b5-43d7-b9ef-0f271c8d301b">
<t>
An Upper Layer Protocol (ULP) is typically defined
independently of any particular RPC transport.
An Upper Layer Binding (ULB) specification provides guidance
that helps the ULP interoperate correctly and efficiently
over a particular transport.
For RPC-over-RDMA version 2, a ULB may provide:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A taxonomy of XDR data items that are eligible for DDP
</t>
<t>
Constraints on which upper-layer procedures may be reduced and on
how many chunks may appear in a single RPC request
</t>
<t>
A method for determining the maximum size of the reply Payload
stream for all procedures in the ULP
</t>
<t>
An rpcbind port assignment for operation of the RPC Program and
Version on an RPC-over-RDMA transport
</t>
</list>
Each RPC Program and Version tuple that utilizes RPC-over-RDMA
version 2 needs to have a ULB specification.
</t>

<section
 title="DDP-Eligibility"
 anchor="section:2f2b32a4-d78a-45f0-b6a3-fa0e2d34a97b">
<t>
An ULB designates some XDR data items as eligible for DDP.
As an RPC-over-RDMA message is formed,
DDP-eligible data items can be removed from the Payload stream
and placed directly in the receiver's memory.
An XDR data item should be considered for DDP-eligibility if there is
a clear benefit to moving the contents of the item directly from the
sender's memory to the receiver's memory.
</t>
<t>
Criteria for DDP-eligibility include:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The XDR data item is frequently sent or received, and its size is
often much larger than typical inline thresholds.
</t>
<t>
If the XDR data item is a result, its maximum size must be
predictable in advance by the requester.
</t>
<t>
Transport-level processing of the XDR data item is not needed.
For example, the data item is an opaque byte array, which requires
no XDR encoding and decoding of its content.
</t>
<t>
The content of the XDR data item is sensitive to address alignment.
For example, a data copy operation would be required
on the receiver to enable the message to be parsed correctly,
or
to enable the data item to be accessed.
</t>
<t>
The XDR data item does not contain DDP-eligible data items.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
In addition to defining the set of data items that are DDP-eligible,
a ULB may also limit the use of chunks to particular upper-layer
procedures.
If more than one data item in a procedure is DDP-eligible,
the ULB may also limit the number of chunks that a requester
can provide for a particular upper-layer procedure.
</t>
<t>
Senders MUST NOT reduce data items that are not DDP-eligible.
Such data items MAY, however, be moved as part of a Position Zero Read
chunk or a Reply chunk.
</t>
<t>
The programming interface by which an upper-layer implementation
indicates the DDP-eligibility of a data item to the RPC transport is
not described by this specification.
The only requirements are that
the receiver can re-assemble the transmitted RPC-over-RDMA message
into a valid XDR stream, and that DDP-eligibility rules specified
by the ULB are respected.
</t>
<t>
There is no provision to express DDP-eligibility within the XDR
language.
The only definitive specification of DDP-eligibility is a ULB.
</t>
<t>
In general, a DDP-eligibility violation occurs when:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
A requester reduces a non-DDP-eligible argument data item.
The Responder MUST NOT process this RPC Call message and MUST report
the violation as described in Section TBD.
</t>
<t>
A Responder reduces a non-DDP-eligible result data item.
The requester MUST terminate the pending RPC transaction
and report an appropriate permanent error to the RPC consumer.
</t>
<t>
A Responder does not reduce a DDP-eligible result data item into
an available Write chunk.
The requester MUST terminate the pending RPC transaction
and report an appropriate permanent error to the RPC consumer.
</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Maximum Reply Size"
 anchor="section:a3f15fe3-2677-4d94-adb5-afa80c7e197a">
<t>
A requester provides resources for both
an RPC Call message
and
its matching RPC Reply message.
A requester forms each RPC Call itself,
thus it can compute the exact resources needed to send every Call.
However, the requester must allocate resources
to receive the corresponding Reply before the responder has formed it.
In some cases it is difficult for the requester to know in advance
precisely what resources will be needed to receive the Reply.
</t>
<t>
In RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
a requester MAY provide a Reply chunk at any time,
and a responder MAY use a provided Reply chunk or not.
If the combination of the provided Write chunk list and Reply chunk
is not adequate to convey a Reply, the responder MUST use
Message Continuation to send that Reply.
</t>
<t>
If even that is not possible, the responder
responds with an RDMA2_ERROR message:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The responder MUST send a RDMA2_ERR_WRITE_RESOURCE error
if the Write chunk list cannot accommodate the ULP's DDP-eligible data payload.
</t>
<t>
The responder MUST send a RDMA2_ERR_REPLY_RESOURCE error
if the Reply chunk cannot accommodate the non DDP-eligible parts of the Reply.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
If there are procedures in the ULP for which there is no clear reply
size maximum, the ULB should specify a dependable means for
determining the maximum Reply size for that ULP procedure.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Additional Considerations"
 anchor="section:e568723e-3dd8-4a54-9401-92ae4f98f88f">
<t>
There may be other details provided in a ULB.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
An ULB may recommend inline threshold values or other transport-related
parameters for RPC-over-RDMA version 2 connections bearing that ULP.
</t>
<t>
An ULP may provide a means to communicate these transport-related
parameters between peers.
Note that RPC-over-RDMA version 2 does not specify any mechanism
for changing any transport-related parameter after a connection
has been established and the initial transport properties
have been exchanged.
</t>
<t>
Multiple ULPs may share a single RPC-over-RDMA version 2
connection when their ULBs allow the use of RPC-over-RDMA version 2
and the rpcbind port assignments for the Protocols allow
connection sharing.
In this case, the same transport parameters (such as inline threshold)
apply to all Protocols using that connection.
</t>
</list>
Each ULB needs to be designed to allow correct interoperation without
regard to the transport parameters actually in use.
Furthermore, implementations of ULPs must be designed
to interoperate correctly
regardless of the connection parameters in effect on a connection.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="ULP Extensions"
 anchor="section:db58c83f-091c-481e-ba7c-a0246d1c475b">
<t>
An RPC Program and Version tuple may be extensible.
For instance, there may be a minor versioning scheme
that is not reflected in the RPC version number,
or
the ULP may allow additional features to be
specified after the original RPC Program specification was ratified.
ULBs are provided for interoperable RPC Programs and Versions by
extending existing ULBs to reflect the changes made necessary by each
addition to the existing XDR.

<section
 title="Extending the Version 2 Protocol"
 anchor="section:84e1ffc4-d916-4eb4-9fd8-a8218d084503">
<t>
This Appendix is not addressed to protocol implementers,
but rather to authors of documents that intend to extend
the protocol described earlier in this document.
</t>
<t>
Subsequent RPC-over-RDMA versions are free to change the protocol
in any way they choose as long as they maintain the first four header words
as currently specified by
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
</t>
<t>
Such changes might involve deletion or major re-organization of
existing transport headers.
However, the need for interoperability between adjacent versions
will often limit the scope of changes that can be made in a single version.
</t>
<t>
In some cases it may prove desirable to transition to a new version
by using the extension features described for use with RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
by continuing the same basic extension model but allowing header types
and properties that were OPTIONAL in one version to become REQUIRED
in the subsequent version.
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 is designed to be extensible
in a way that enables the addition of OPTIONAL features
that may subsequently be converted to REQUIRED status
in a future protocol version.
The protocol may be extended by Standards Track documents
in a way analogous to that provided for Network File
System Version 4 as described in
<xref target="RFC8178"/>.
</t>
<t>
This form of extensibility enables limited extensions
to the base RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol presented
in this document so that new optional capabilities
can be introduced without a protocol version change,
while maintaining robust interoperability
with existing RPC-over-RDMA version 2 implementations.
The design allows extensions to be
defined, including the definition of new protocol elements, without
requiring modification or recompilation of the existing XDR.
</t>
<t>
A Standards Track document introduces each set of such protocol elements.
Together these elements are considered an OPTIONAL feature.
Each implementation is either aware of all the protocol
elements introduced by that feature or is aware of none of them.
</t>
<t>
Documents describing extensions to RPC-over-RDMA version 2 should
contain:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
An explanation of the purpose and use of each new protocol element added.
</t>
<t>
An XDR description including all of the new protocol elements,
and a script to extract it.
</t>
<t>
A description of interactions with existing extensions.
<vspace blankLines="1"/>
This includes possible requirements of other OPTIONAL features
to be present for new protocol elements to work,
or that a particular level of support
for an OPTIONAL facility is required for the new extension to work.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Implementers combine the XDR descriptions of the new features they
intend to use with the XDR description of the base protocol in this
document.
This may be necessary to create a valid XDR input file
because extensions are free to use XDR types defined in the base
protocol, and later extensions may use types defined by earlier
extensions.
</t>
<t>
The XDR description for the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 base protocol
combined with that for any selected extensions
should provide an adequate human-readable description
of the extended protocol.
</t>
<t>
The base protocol specified in this document may be extended within
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 in two ways:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
New OPTIONAL transport header types may be introduced by later
Standards Track documents.
Such transport header types will be documented as described in
<xref target="section:d4650151-40f0-4e85-8755-02c38cf8f444"/>.
</t>
<t>
New OPTIONAL transport properties may be defined in later
Standards Track documents.
Such transport properties will be documented as described in
<xref target="section:a355adad-f03b-41a6-94a8-4128b10301bb"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The following sorts of ancillary  protocol elements may be added
to the protocol to support the addition of new transport properties
and header types.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
New error codes may be created as described in
<xref target="section:c2f5e937-d612-4e3a-a380-e0b15261f6a0"/>.
</t>
<t>
New flags to use within the rdma_flags field may be created as described in
<xref target="section:15c76685-a24d-4799-bc8a-311d03ac3510"/>.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
New capabilities can be proposed and developed independently of each other,
and implementers can choose among them.
This makes it straightforward to create and document experimental features
and then bring them through the standards process.

A complete XDR description of the new header type including a description
of the use of all fields within the header.

A description of how errors are reported, including the definition
of a mechanism for reporting errors when the error is outside the
available choices already available in the base protocol or in
other existing extensions.

<t>
An indication of whether a Payload stream must be present,
and a description of its contents and how such payload streams
are used to construct RPC messages for processing.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
In addition, there needs to be additional documentation that is made
necessary due to the Optional status of new transport header types.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Information about constraints on support for the new header types should

A preferred method by which a sender should determine whether the peer
supports a particular header type needs to be provided.
While it is always possible for a send a test invocation
of a particular header type to see if support is available,
when more efficient means are available

<t>
The set of transport properties is designed to be extensible.
As a result, once new properties are defined in standards track documents,
the operations defined in this document may reference these new
transport properties, as well as the ones described in this document.
</t>
<t>
A standards track document defining a new transport property should
include the following information paralleling that provided in this
document for the transport properties defined herein.
<list style="symbols">

<t>
The definition of transport property structures is such as to make it
easy to assign unique values.
There is no requirement that a continuous set of values be used and
implementations should not rely on all such values being small integers.
A unique value should be selected when the defining document is first
published as an internet draft.
When the document becomes a standards track document,
the working group should ensure that:
<list style="symbols">

rpcrdma2_propid values specified in the document do not conflict
with those currently assigned or in use by other pending working
group documents defining transport properties.

 title="Adding New Error Codes to the Protocol"
 anchor="section:c2f5e937-d612-4e3a-a380-e0b15261f6a0">
<t>
New error codes to be returned when using new header types
may be introduced in the same Standards Track document
that defines the new header type.
Cases in which a new error code is to be returned
by an existing header type can be accommodated
by defining the new error code
in the same Standards Track document that defines
the new transport property.
</t>
<t>
For error codes that do not require that additional error
information be returned with them,
the existing RDMA_ERR2 header can be used to report the new error.
The new error code is set as the value of rdma_err with
the result that the default switch arm of the rpcrdma2_error
(i.e. void) is selected.
</t>
<t>
For error codes that do require the return of additional error-related
information together with the error, a new header type should be defined
for the purpose of returning the error together with needed additional
information.
It should be documented just like any other new header type.

When a new header type is sent, the sender needs to be prepared to accept
header types necessary to report associated errors.

There are currently thirty-one flags available for later assignment.
One possible use for such flags would be in a later protocol version,
should that version retain the same general header structure as version 2.
</t>
<t>
In addition, it is possible to assign unused flags within
extensions made to version 2, as long as the following practices are adhered to:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
Flags should not be added to the flag word in the prefix structure if those
flags only apply to a single header type.
New flags should only be defined for conditions applying to multiple header types.
</t>
<t>
The document defining the new flag should indicate for which header types
the flag value is meaningful and for which header types it is an error to set
the flag or to leave it unset.
</t>
<t>
The sender needs to be provided with a means to determine whether the receiver
is prepared to receive transport headers with the new flag set.
This is most likely to take the form of a transport property
together with the definition of suitable defaults
to use when that property is not supported.
Another possibility is to REQUIRE that receivers
supporting a particular header type also support a set of additional flags.

This section describes the substantive changes made in
RPC-over-RDMA version 2.
</t>

<section
 title="Relationship to the RPC-over-RDMA Version 1 XDR Definition"
 anchor="section:d945b9f0-0666-4db7-9126-be57cf7b5f4f">
<t>
There are a number of structural XDR changes whose goal
is to enable within-version protocol extensibility.
</t>
<t>
The RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport header is defined as a single XDR object,
with an RPC message proper potentially following it.
In RPC-over-RDMA version 2, as described in
<xref target="section:417e749e-efec-455f-aae7-12535b9ee8dc"/>
there are separate XDR definitions of the transport header prefix
(see
<xref target="section:2d1735f0-c465-43c6-9c18-3da6b7979862"/>
which specifies the transport header type to be used,
and the specific transport header, defined within one of the subsections of
<xref target="section:eef6a22e-2633-44a2-a8f0-821fec8bf824"/>).
This is similar to the way that an RPC message consists of
an RPC header (defined in
<xref target="RFC5531"/>)
and an RPC request or reply,
defined by the Upper Layer protocol being conveyed.
</t>
<t>
As a new version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 exists within the versioning rules defined in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
In particular, it maintains the first four words of the protocol header
as sent and received,
as specified in Section 4.2 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>,
even though, as explained in
<xref target="section:e21d4f74-b536-47f2-9d07-c03a27a20de4"/>
of this document,
the XDR definition of those words is structured differently.
</t>
<t>
Although each of the first four words retains its semantic function,
there are important differences of field interpretation, besides the fact
that the words have different names and different roles with the XDR
constrict of they are parts.
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The first word of the header, previously the rdma_xid field,
retains the format and function that in had in
RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
this word is the rdma_xid field of the structure rdma_start.
However, to accommodate the use of request-response
pairing of non-RPC messages and the potential use of message continuation,
it cannot be assumed that it will always have the same value
it would have had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
As a result, the contents of this field should not be used
without consideration of the associated protocol version identification.
</t>
<t>
The second word of the header, previously the rdma_vers field,
retains the format and function that it had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
this word is the rdma_vers field of the structure rdma_start.
To clearly distinguish version 1 and version 2 messages,
senders MUST fill in the correct version (fixed after version negotiation)
and receivers MUST check that the content of the rdma_vers is correct
before using referencing any other header field.
</t>
<t>
The third word of the header, previously the rdma_credit field,
retains the size and general purpose that it had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
this word is the rdma_credit field of the structure rdma_start.
</t>
<t>
The fourth word of the header,
previously the union discriminator field rdma_proc,
retains its format and general function even though
the set of valid values has changed.
The value of this field is now considered an unsigned 32-bit integer
rather than an enum.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
this word is the rdma_htype field of the structure rdma_start.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Beyond conforming to the restrictions specified in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 tightly limits the scope
of the changes made in order to ensure interoperability.
It makes no major structural changes to the protocol,
and all existing transport header types used in version 1
(as defined in
<xref target="RFC8166"/>)
are retained in version 2.
Chunks are expressed using the same on-the-wire format and
are used in the same way in both versions.

 title="Transport Properties"
 anchor="section:630314a8-1cf5-40f7-a5ad-5bc12c719233">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides a mechanism for
exchanging the transport's operational properties.
This mechanism allows connection endpoints to communicate the properties
of their implementation at connection setup.
The mechanism could be expanded to enable an endpoint to request changes
in properties of the other endpoint and to notify peer endpoints of
changes to properties that occur during operation.

 title="Credit Management Changes"
 anchor="section:5a2e5ff8-0f0b-454d-b9b3-c6773cd77780">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA transports employ credit-based flow control
to ensure that a requester does not emit more RDMA Sends
than the responder is prepared to receive.
Section 3.3.1 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
explains the purpose and operation
of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 credit management in detail.
</t>
<t>
In the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 design,
each RDMA Send from a requester contains an RPC Call with a credit request,
and each RDMA Send from a responder contains an RPC Reply with a credit grant.
The credit grant implies that enough Receives have been posted on
the responder to handle the credit grant minus the number of pending
RPC transactions (the number of remaining Receive buffers might be zero).
</t>
<t>
In other words, each RPC Reply acts as an implicit ACK
for a previous RPC Call from the requester,
indicating that the responder has posted a Receive to replace
the Receive consumed by the requester's RDMA Send.
Without an RPC Reply message, the requester has no way to know
that the responder is properly prepared for subsequent RPC Calls.
</t>
<t>
Aside from being a bit of a layering violation,
there are basic (but rare) cases where this arrangement is inadequate:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
When a requester retransmits an RPC Call on the same connection
as an earlier RPC Call for the same transaction.
</t>
<t>
When a requester transmits an RPC operation that requires no reply.
</t>
<t>
When more than one RPC-over-RDMA message is needed to complete the
transaction (e.g., RDMA_DONE).
</t>
</list>
Typically, the connection must be replaced in these cases.
This resets the credit accounting mechanism but has an undesirable impact
on other ongoing RPC transactions on that connection.
</t>
<t>
Because credit management accompanies each RPC message,
there is a strict one-to-one ratio between RDMA Send and RPC message.
There are interesting use cases that might be enabled if this relationship
were more flexible:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA operations which do not carry an RPC message;
e.g., control plane operations.
</t>
<t>
A single RDMA Send that conveys more than one RPC message
for the purpose of interrupt mitigation.
</t>
<t>
An RPC message that is conveyed via several sequential RDMA Sends
to reduce the use of explicit RDMA operations for moderate-sized RPC messages.
</t>
<t>
An RPC transaction that needs multiple exchanges
or an odd number of RPC-over-RDMA operations
to complete.
</t>
</list>
Bi-directional RPC operation also introduces an ambiguity.
If the RPC-over-RDMA message does not carry an RPC message, then
it is not possible to determine whether the sender is a requester
or a responder, and thus whether the rdma_credit field contains
a credit request or a credit grant.
</t>
<t>
A more sophisticated credit accounting mechanism is provided in
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 in an attempt to address some of these shortcomings.
This new mechanism is detailed in
<xref target="section:88b2fc9e-5fea-4195-bc6e-00a37ba116ef"/>.

<section
 title="Inline Threshold Changes"
 anchor="section:f7fb5108-58ea-4718-84be-5119a302f5f5">
<t>
The term "inline threshold" is defined in Section 3.3.2 of
<xref target="RFC8166"/>.
An "inline threshold" value is the largest message size (in octets)
that can be conveyed on an RDMA connection using only RDMA Send and Receive.
Each connection has two inline threshold values: one for messages
flowing from
client-to-server (referred to as the "client-to-server inline threshold")
and one for messages flowing from server-to-client
(referred to as the "server-to-client inline threshold").
Note that
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
uses somewhat different terminology.
This is because it was written
with only forward-direction RPC transactions in mind.
</t>
<t>
A connection's inline thresholds determine when RDMA Read or
Write operations are required because the RPC message to be
sent cannot be conveyed via a single RDMA Send and Receive pair.
When an RPC message does not contain DDP-eligible data items,
a requester can prepare a Long Call or Reply to convey the whole
RPC message using RDMA Read or Write operations.
</t>
<t>
RDMA Read and Write operations require that each data payload
resides in a region of memory that is registered with the RNIC.
When an RPC is complete, that region is invalidated, fencing it
from the responder.
Memory registration and invalidation typically have a latency cost
that is insignificant compared to data handling costs.
When a data payload is small, however, the cost of registering and
invalidating the memory where the payload resides becomes
a relatively significant part of total RPC latency.
Therefore the most efficient operation of RPC-over-RDMA occurs
when explicit RDMA Read and Write operations are used for large payloads,
and are avoided for small payloads.
</t>
<t>
When RPC-over-RDMA version 1 was conceived, the typical size
of RPC messages that did not involve a significant data payload
was under 500 bytes.
A 1024-byte inline threshold adequately minimized the frequency
of inefficient Long messages.
</t>
<t>
With NFS version 4.1
<xref target="RFC5661"/>,
the increased size of NFS COMPOUND operations
resulted in RPC messages that are on average larger
and more complex than previous versions of NFS.
With 1024-byte inline thresholds, RDMA Read or Write operations
are needed for frequent operations that do not bear a data payload,
such as GETATTR and LOOKUP,
reducing the efficiency of the transport.
</t>
<t>
To reduce the need to use Long messages, RPC-over-RDMA
version 2 increases the default size of inline thresholds.
This also increases the maximum size of reverse-direction
RPC messages.
</t>
<t>
In addition to a larger default inline threshold,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 introduces Message Continuation.
Message Continuation is a mechanism that enables
the transmission of a data payload using more than one RDMA Send.
The purpose of Message Continuation
is to provide relief in several important cases:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
If a requester finds that it is inefficient to
convey a moderately-sized data payload using Read chunks,
the requester can use Message Continuation to send the RPC Call.
</t>
<t>
If a requester has provided insufficient Reply chunk space
for a responder to send an RPC Reply,
the responder can use Message Continuation to send the RPC Reply.
</t>
<t>
If a sender has to convey a large non-RPC data payload
(e.g, a large transport property),
the sender can use Message Continuation to avoid using registered memory.

 title="Host Authentication Changes"
 anchor="section:16f03208-32cb-451d-90ab-a6f5f4b9e9b0">
<t>
For general operation of NFS on open networks,
we eventually intend to rely on RPC-on-TLS [citation needed]
to provide cryptographic authentication of the two ends of each connection.
In turn, this will improve the trustworthiness of AUTH_SYS-style user identities
that flow on TCP, which are not cryptographic.
We do not have a similar solution for RPC-over-RDMA, however.
</t>
<t>
Here, the RDMA transport layer already provides a strong guarantee of message
integrity.
On some network fabrics, IPsec can be used to protect the privacy of in-transit data,
or TLS itself could be used for transporting raw RDMA operations.
However, this is not the case for all fabrics
(e.g., InfiniBand <xref target="IB"/>).
</t>
<t>
Thus, it is sensible to add a mechanism in the RPC-over-RDMA transport itself
for authenticating the connection peers.
This mechanism is described in Section TBD.
And like GSS channel binding, there should also be a way to determine
when the use of host authentication is superfluous and can be avoided.

 title="Support for Remote Invalidation"
 anchor="section:57c034d6-7129-4f7b-b8df-31e8bc691964">
<t>
An STag that is registered using
the FRWR mechanism in a privileged execution context
or is registered via a Memory Window in an unprivileged context
may be invalidated remotely
<xref target="RFC5040"/>.
These mechanisms are available when a requester's
RNIC supports MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS.
</t>
<t>
For the purposes of this discussion, there are two classes of STags.
Dynamically-registered STags are used in a single RPC, then invalidated.
Persistently-registered STags live longer than one RPC.
They may persist for the life of an RPC-over-RDMA connection, or longer.
</t>
<t>
An RPC-over-RDMA requester may provide more than one STag
in one transport header.
It may provide a combination of dynamically- and
persistently-registered STags in one RPC message, or
any combination of these in a series of RPCs on the same connection.
Only dynamically-registered STags using Memory Windows
or FRWR (i.e., registered via MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS) may be invalidated remotely.
</t>
<t>
There is no transport-level mechanism by which a responder can determine
how a requester-provided STag was registered, nor whether it is
eligible to be invalidated remotely.
A requester that mixes persistently- and dynamically-registered STags in one RPC,
or mixes them across RPCs on the same connection,
must therefore indicate which handles may be invalidated via a mechanism
provided in the Upper Layer Protocol.
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides such a mechanism.
</t>
<t>
The RDMA Send With Invalidate operation is used to invalidate an
STag on a remote system.
It is available only when a responder's RNIC supports MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS,
and must be utilized only when a requester's RNIC supports MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS
(can receive and recognize an IETH).
</t>

<section
 title="Reverse Direction Remote Invalidation"
 anchor="section:750a8d5e-1d5a-4fd7-afa3-e156561d20e5">
<t>
Existing RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol specifications
<xref target="RFC8166"/>
<xref target="RFC8167"/>
do not forbid direct data placement in the reverse direction,
even though there is currently no Upper Layer Protocol that
makes data items in reverse direction operations elegible
for direct data placement.
</t>
<t>
When chunks are present in a reverse direction RPC request,
Remote Invalidation allows the responder
to trigger invalidation of a requester's STags as part of sending a reply,
the same way as is done in the forward direction.
</t>
<t>
However, in the reverse direction,
the server acts as the requester,
and the client is the responder.
The server's RNIC, therefore, must support receiving an IETH,
and the server must have registered the STags
with an appropriate registration mechanism.

 title="Error Reporting Changes"
 anchor="section:e554df42-6e82-4e28-96a0-8f9872eb476c">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 expands the repertoire of errors that
may be reported by connection endpoints.
This change, which is structured to enable extensibility,
allows a peer to report overruns of specific resources
and to avoid requester retries when an error is permanent.
