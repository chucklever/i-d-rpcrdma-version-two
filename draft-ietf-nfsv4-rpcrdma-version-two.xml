Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
<xref target="RFC5040" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
<xref target="RFC5041" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
<xref target="IBA" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
is a technique for moving data efficiently between network nodes.
By placing transferred data directly into destination buffers
using Direct Memory Access, RDMA delivers the reciprocal benefits of
faster data transfer
and
reduced host CPU overhead.
</t>
<t>
Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call
(ONC RPC, often shortened in NFSv4 documents to RPC)
<xref target="RFC5531" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
is a Remote Procedure Call protocol
that runs over a variety of transports.
Most RPC implementations today use
UDP
<xref target="RFC0768" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
or
TCP
<xref target="RFC0793" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
On UDP, a datagram encapsulates each RPC message.
Within a TCP byte stream,
a record marking protocol delineates RPC messages.
</t>
<t>
An RDMA transport, too, conveys RPC messages
in a fashion that must be fully defined
if RPC implementations are to interoperate
when using RDMA to transport RPC transactions.
Although RDMA transports encapsulate messages like UDP,
they deliver them reliably and in order, like TCP.
Further, they implement a bulk data transfer service
not provided by traditional network transports.
Therefore, we treat RDMA as a novel transport type for RPC.

<name>Design Goals</name>

<t>
The general mission of RPC-over-RDMA transports is to
leverage network hardware capabilities to
reduce host CPU needs related to the transport of RPC messages.
In particular, this includes
mitigating host interrupt rates
and
limiting the necessity to copy RPC payload bytes on receivers.
</t>
<t>
These hardware capabilities benefit both RPC clients and servers.
On balance, however, the RPC-over-RDMA protocol design approach
has been to bolster clients more than servers, as the client is
typically where applications are most hungry for CPU resources.
</t>
<t>
Additionally,
RPC-over-RDMA transports are designed to
support RPC applications transparently.
However, such transports can also provide mechanisms
that enable further optimization of data transfer
when RPC applications are structured
to exploit direct data placement.
In this context, the Network File System (NFS) family of protocols
(as described in
<xref target="RFC1094" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
<xref target="RFC1813" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
<xref target="RFC7530" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
<xref target="RFC7862" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
<xref target="RFC8881" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
and subsequent NFSv4 minor versions)
are all potential beneficiaries of RPC-over-RDMA.
</t>
<t>
A complete problem statement appears in
<xref target="RFC5532" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.

<name>Motivation for a New Version</name>
<t>
Storage administrators have broadly deployed
the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 protocol specified in
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
However, there are known shortcomings to this protocol:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The protocol's default size of Receive buffers forces
the use of RDMA Read and Write transfers for small payloads,
and limits the size of reverse-direction messages.
</li>
<li>
It is difficult to make optimizations or protocol fixes
that require changes to on-the-wire behavior.
</li>
<li>
For some RPC procedures, the maximum reply size is
difficult or impossible for an RPC client to estimate
in advance.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
To address these issues in a way that preserves interoperation
with existing RPC-over-RDMA version 1 deployments,
the current document presents
an updated version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol.
</t>
<t>
This version of RPC-over-RDMA is extensible,
enabling the introduction of <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> extensions
without impacting existing implementations.
See
<xref target="section_d945b9f0-0666-4db7-9126-be57cf7b5f4f" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
for further discussion.
It introduces a mechanism to exchange implementation properties
to automatically provide further optimization of data transfer.
</t>
<t>
This version also contains incremental changes that
relieve performance constraints
and
enable recovery from unusual corner cases.
These changes are outlined in
<xref target="section_c2574344-5aec-427d-a5ed-048d7fcc0d95" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
and include
a larger default inline threshold,
the ability to convey a single RPC message using multiple RDMA Send operations,
support for authentication of connection peers,
richer error reporting,
improved credit-based flow control,
and
support for Remote Invalidation.

<name>Upper-Layer Protocols</name>
<t>
RPCs are an abstraction used to implement the operations of an Upper-Layer Protocol (ULP).
For RPC-over-RDMA, "ULP" refers to an RPC Program and Version tuple,
which is a versioned set of procedure calls that comprise a single well-defined API.
One example of a ULP is the Network File System Version 4.0
<xref target="RFC7530" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
In the current document, the term "RPC consumer" refers to
an implementation of a ULP running on an RPC client.

<name>Requesters and Responders</name>
<t>
Like a local procedure call,
every RPC procedure has a set of "arguments" and a set of "results".
A calling context invokes a procedure,
passing arguments to it,
and the procedure subsequently returns a set of results.
Unlike a local procedure call,
the called procedure is executed remotely rather than
in the local application's execution context.
</t>
<t>
The RPC protocol as described in
<xref target="RFC5531" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
is fundamentally a message-passing protocol
between one or more clients, where RPC consumers are running,
and a server, where a remote execution context is available
to process RPC transactions on behalf of these consumers.
</t>
<t>
ONC RPC transactions consist of two types of messages:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
A CALL message, or "Call", requests work.
An RPC Call message is designated
by the value zero (0) in the message's msg_type field.
The sender places a unique 32-bit value in the message's XID field
to match this RPC Call message to a corresponding RPC Reply message.
</li>
<li>
A REPLY message, or "Reply",
reports the results of work requested by an RPC Call message.
An RPC Reply message is designated
by the value one (1) in the message's msg_type field.
The sender copies the value contained in an RPC Reply message's XID field
from the RPC Call message whose results the sender is reporting.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
Each RPC client endpoint acts as a "Requester",
which serializes the procedure's arguments
and
conveys them to a server endpoint via an RPC Call message.
A Call message contains an RPC protocol header,
a header describing the requested upper-layer operation,
and all arguments.
</t>
<t>
An RPC server endpoint acts as a "Responder",
which deserializes the arguments and processes the requested operation.
It then serializes the operation's results into an RPC Reply message.
An RPC Reply message contains an RPC protocol header,
a header describing the upper-layer reply,
and all results.
</t>
<t>
The Requester deserializes the results
and
allows the RPC consumer to proceed.
At this point, the RPC transaction
designated by the XID in the RPC Call message is complete,
and the XID is retired.
</t>
<t>
In summary,
Requesters send RPC Call messages to Responders
to initiate RPC transactions.
Responders send RPC Reply messages to Requesters
to complete the processing on an RPC transaction.
</t>

<name>RPC Transports</name>
<t>
The role of an "RPC transport" is
to mediate the exchange of RPC messages
between Requesters and Responders.
An RPC transport bridges the gap
between the RPC message abstraction
and
the native operations of a network transport
(e.g., a socket).
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA is a connection-oriented RPC transport.
When a transport type is connection-oriented,
clients initiate transport connections,
while servers wait passively to accept incoming connection requests.

<name>Transport Failure Recovery</name>
<t>
So that appropriate and timely recovery action can be taken,
the transport implementation is responsible for notifying
a Requester when an RPC Call or Reply was not able to be conveyed.
Recovery can take the form of establishing a new connection,
re-sending RPC Calls, or terminating RPC transactions pending
on the Requester.
</t>
<t>
For instance, a connection loss may occur after a Responder
has received an RPC Call but before it can send the matching RPC Reply.
Once the transport notifies the Requester of the connection loss,
the Requester can re-send all pending RPC Calls on a fresh connection.

<name>Forward Direction</name>
<t>
Traditionally, an RPC client acts as a Requester,
while an RPC service acts as a Responder.
The current document
refers to this direction of RPC message passing
as "forward-direction" operation.
</t>

<name>Reverse-Direction</name>
<t>
The RPC specification
<xref target="RFC5531" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
does not forbid performing RPC transactions
in the other direction.
An RPC service endpoint can act as a Requester,
in which case an RPC client endpoint acts as a Responder.
This direction of RPC message passing is known as
"reverse-direction" operation.
</t>
<t>
During reverse-direction operation,
an RPC client is responsible
for establishing transport connections,
even though the RPC server originates RPC Calls.
</t>
<t>
RPC clients and servers are usually optimized
to perform and scale well when handling traffic
in the forward direction.
They might not be prepared to handle operation
in the reverse direction.
Not until NFS version 4.1
<xref target="RFC8881" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
has there been a strong need
to handle reverse-direction operation.

<name>Bi-directional Operation</name>
<t>
A pair of connected RPC endpoints may choose to use
only forward-direction
or
only reverse-direction operation
on a particular transport connection.
Or, these endpoints may send Calls
in both directions concurrently
on the same transport connection.
</t>
<t>
"Bi-directional operation" occurs when both transport endpoints
act as a Requester and a Responder at the same time
on a single connection.
</t>
<t>
Bi-directionality is an extension
of RPC transport connection sharing.
Two RPC endpoints wish to exchange
independent RPC messages over a shared connection
but in opposite directions.
These messages may or may not be related
to the same workloads or RPC Programs.

introduces the RPC transaction identifier,
or "XID" for short.
A connection peer interprets the value of an XID
in the context of the message's msg_type field.
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The XID of a Call is arbitrary but is
unique among outstanding Calls from that Requester
on that connection.
</li>
<li>
The XID of a Reply always matches
that of the initiating Call.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
After receiving a Reply,
a Requester matches the XID value in that Reply
with a Call it previously sent.
</t>
<t>
During bi-directional operation,
forward- and reverse- direction XIDs
are typically generated
on distinct hosts by possibly different algorithms.
There is no coordination between the generation of XIDs
used in forward-direction and reverse-direction operation.
</t>
<t>
Therefore, a forward-direction Requester
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use the same XID value at the same time
as a reverse-direction Requester
on the same transport connection.
Although such concurrent requests use the same XID value,
they represent distinct RPC transactions.

<name>External Data Representation</name>
<t>
One cannot assume that all Requesters and Responders
represent data objects in the same way internally.
RPC uses External Data Representation (XDR)
to translate native data types and serialize arguments and results
<xref target="RFC4506" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</t>
<t>
XDR encodes data independently
of the endianness or size of host-native data types,
enabling unambiguous decoding of data by a receiver.
</t>
<t>
XDR assumes only that the number of bits in a byte (octet)
and
their order are the same on both endpoints and the physical network.
The smallest indivisible unit of XDR encoding is a group of four octets.
XDR can also flatten
lists,
arrays,
and
other complex data types
into a stream of bytes.
</t>
<t>
We refer to a serialized stream of bytes
that is the result of XDR encoding
as an "XDR stream".
A sender encodes native data
into an XDR stream and then transmits that stream to a receiver.
The receiver decodes incoming XDR byte streams
into its native data representation format.

Sometimes, a data item is to be transferred as-is,
without encoding or decoding.
We refer to the contents of such a data item as "opaque data".
XDR encoding places the content of opaque data items
directly into an XDR stream without altering it in any way.
ULPs or applications perform
any needed data translation in this case.
Examples of opaque data items include the content of files
or generic byte strings.

<t>
The number of octets in a variable-length data item
precedes that item in an XDR stream.
If the size of an encoded data item is not a multiple of four octets,
the sender appends octets containing zero after the end of the data item.
These zero octets shift the next encoded data item in the XDR stream
so that it always starts on a four-octet boundary.
The addition of extra octets does not change
the encoded size of the data item.
Receivers do not expose the extra octets to ULPs.

We refer to this technique as "XDR roundup",

<name>Remote Direct Memory Access</name>
<t>
When a third party transfers large RPC payloads,
RPC Requesters and Responders can become more efficient.
An example of such a third party might be
an intelligent network interface
(data movement offload),
which places data in the receiver's memory so that
no additional adjustment of data alignment is necessary
(direct data placement or "DDP").
RDMA transports enable both of these optimizations.
</t>
<t>
In the current document, the standalone term "RDMA" refers to
the physical mechanism an RDMA transport utilizes when moving data.

<t>
Typically, RPC implementations copy
the contents of RPC messages into a buffer before being sent.
An efficient RPC implementation sends bulk data
without first copying it into a separate send buffer.
</t>
<t>
However, socket-based RPC implementations
are often unable to receive data directly
into its final place in memory.
Receivers often need to copy incoming data
to finish an RPC operation,
if only to adjust data alignment.
</t>
<t>
Although it may not be efficient,
before an RDMA transfer, a sender may copy data into an intermediate buffer.
After an RDMA transfer, a receiver may copy that data again to its final destination.
In this document, the term "DDP" refers to
any optimized data transfer where a receiving host's CPU
does not move transferred data
to another location after arrival.
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 enables the use of RDMA Read and Write operations
to achieve both data movement offload and DDP.
However, note that
not all RDMA-based data transfer qualifies as DDP,
and
some mechanisms that do not employ explicit RDMA can place data directly.

<name>RDMA Transport Operation</name>

RDMA transports require that
RDMA consumers provision resources in advance
to achieve good performance during receive operations.
An RDMA consumer might provide Receive buffers in advance
by posting an RDMA Receive Work Request
for every expected RDMA Send from a remote peer.
These buffers are provided
before the remote peer posts RDMA Send Work Requests.
Thus this is often referred to as "pre-posting" buffers.
</t>
<t>
An RDMA Receive Work Request remains outstanding
until the RDMA provider matches it to an inbound Send operation.
The resources associated with that Receive must be retained in
host memory, or "pinned", until the Receive completes.

Given these tenets of operation,
the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol assumes
each transport provides the following abstract operations.

The RPC-over-RDMA framing mechanism described in this section
replaces all other RPC framing mechanisms.
Connection peers use RPC-over-RDMA framing
even when the underlying RDMA protocol runs
on a transport type with well-defined RPC framing, such as TCP.
However, a ULP can negotiate the use of RDMA,
dynamically enabling the use of RPC-over-RDMA on a connection
established on some other transport type.
Because RPC framing delimits an entire RPC request or reply,
the resulting shift in framing must occur between distinct RPC messages,
and in concert with the underlying transport.

To conform with that requirement,

The granted credit value <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be zero
since such a value would result in deadlock.
The high-order two bytes are the maximum number of credits that

<name>When Reverse-Direction Operation is Not Supported</name>
<t>
An RPC-over-RDMA transport endpoint does not
have to support reverse-direction operation.
There might be no mechanism in the transport implementation to do so.
Or, the transport implementation might support
operation in the reverse direction,
but the Upper-Layer Protocol might not
configure the transport to handle reverse-direction traffic.
</t>
<t>
If an endpoint is unprepared to receive a reverse-direction message,
loss of the RDMA connection might result.
Thus a denial of service can occur if an RPC server
continues to send reverse-direction messages
after a client that is not prepared to receive them
reconnects to that server.
</t>
<t>
Connection peers indicate their support for reverse-direction operation
as part of the exchange of Transport Properties
just after a connection is established (see
<xref target="section_6ace2d7f-044b-491f-97ea-5760345a2e8f" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>).
</t>
<t>
When dealing with the possibility that the remote peer
has no transport level support for reverse-direction operation,
the Upper-Layer Protocol is responsible for informing peers
when reverse-direction operation is supported.
Otherwise, even a simple reverse-direction RPC NULL procedure
from a peer could result in a lost connection.
Therefore, an Upper-Layer Protocol <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> perform
reverse-direction RPC operations
until the RPC client indicates support for them.

<name>Using Chunks During Reverse-Direction Operation</name>
<t>
Reverse-direction operations can use chunks for
DDP-eligible data items
and
Special payload formats
the same way chunks are used in forward-direction operation.
Connection peers indicate their support for
using chunks in the reverse direction
as part of the exchange of Transport Properties
just after a connection is established (see
<xref target="section_6ace2d7f-044b-491f-97ea-5760345a2e8f" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>).
</t>
<t>
However, an implementation might support
only Upper-Layer Protocols
that have no DDP-eligible data items.
Such Upper-Layer Protocols can use only small messages,
or they might have a native mechanism
for restricting the size of reverse-direction RPC messages,
obviating the need to handle chunks in the reverse direction.
</t>
<t>
When there is no Upper-Layer Protocol need
for chunks in the reverse direction,
implementers <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> choose not to provide support
for chunks in the reverse direction,
thus avoiding the complexity of implementing support
for RDMA Reads and Writes in the reverse direction.
When an RPC-over-RDMA transport implementation does not support
chunks in the reverse direction, RPC endpoints use only
the Simple Payload format without data item chunks
or
the Continued Payload format without data item chunks
to send RPC messages in the reverse direction.
</t>
<t>
If a reverse-direction Requester provides a non-empty chunk list
to a Responder that does not support chunks,
the Responder <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> report its lack of support
using one of the error values defined in
<xref target="section_87c5f543-7092-4faf-b13e-0e994e8023a7" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.

In rare cases, an RPC server cannot
complete an RPC transaction
and
cannot send a Reply.
In these cases, the Requester may send the RPC transaction again
using the same RPC XID.
We refer to this as an "RPC retransmission" or a "replay."
</t>
<t>
In the forward direction,
an RPC client is the Requester.
The client is always responsible for ensuring
a transport connection is in place
before sending a dropped Call again.
</t>
<t>
With reverse-direction operation,
an RPC server is the Requester.
Because an RPC server is not responsible
for establishing transport connections with clients,
the Requester is unable to retransmit a reverse-direction Call
whenever there is no transport connection.
In this case,
the RPC server must wait for the RPC client
to re-establish a transport connection
before it can retransmit reverse-direction RPC Calls.
</t>
<t>
If the forward-direction Requester has no work to do,
it can be some time before the RPC client
re-establishes a transport connection.
An RPC server may need to abandon a pending reverse-direction RPC Call
to avoid waiting indefinitely for the client
to re-establish a transport connection.
</t>
<t>
Therefore forward-direction Requesters <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> maintain a transport connection
as long as the RPC server might send reverse-direction Calls.
For example, while an NFS version 4.1 client has
open delegated files
or
active pNFS layouts,
it maintains one or more transport connections
to enable the NFS server to perform callback operations.

RPC-over-RDMA version 2 enables connection endpoints
to exchange information about implementation properties.
Compatible endpoints use this information to optimize data transfer.
Initially, only a small set of transport properties are defined.
The protocol provides header types
to exchange transport properties (see
<xref target="section_977e471d-6948-43da-b3c8-bbb36034bd3e" format="counter" sectionFormat="of"/>
and
<xref target="section_e8fbc443-1f44-4ec6-9132-9a28b4e6c870" format="counter" sectionFormat="of"/>).
</t>
<t>
Both the set of transport properties and the operations used
to communicate them may be extended.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2, such extensions are <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>.
A discussion of extending the set of transport properties appears in

<name>Transport Properties Model</name>
<t>
The current document specifies a basic set of receiver and sender properties.
Such properties are specified using
a code point that identifies the particular transport property
and
a nominally opaque array containing the XDR encoding of the property.
</t>
<t>
The following XDR types handle transport properties:
</t>
<sourcecode name="" type="xdr" markers="true">
<![CDATA[
typedef rpcrdma2_propid uint32;

struct rpcrdma2_propval {
        rpcrdma2_propid rdma_which;
        opaque          rdma_data<>;
};

typedef rpcrdma2_propval rpcrdma2_propset<>;

typedef uint32 rpcrdma2_propsubset<>;
]]>
</sourcecode>
<t>
The rpcrdma2_propid type specifies a distinct transport property.
The property code points are defined as const values rather than
elements in an enum type
to enable the extension by concatenating XDR definition files.
</t>
<t>
The rpcrdma2_propval type carries the value of a transport property.
The rdma_which field identifies the particular property,
and
the rdma_data field contains the associated value of that property.
A zero-length rdma_data field represents
the default value of the property specified by rdma_which.
</t>
<t>
Although the rdma_data field is opaque,
receivers interpret its contents using the XDR type
associated with the property specified by rdma_which.
When the contents of the rdma_data field
do not conform to that XDR type,
the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return the error RDMA2_ERR_BAD_PROPVAL
using the header type RDMA2_ERROR,
as described in
<xref target="section_b1d23e5c-31df-483f-adb7-25430b5de38d" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</t>
<t>
For example, the receiver of a message
containing a valid rpcrdma2_propval returns this error
if the length of rdma_data is greater than
the length of the transferred message.
Also, when the receiver recognizes
the rpcrdma2_propid contained in rdma_which,
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> report the error RDMA2_ERR_BAD_PROPVAL
if either of the following occurs:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The nominally opaque data within rdma_data is not valid when
interpreted using the property-associated typedef.
</li>
<li>
The length of rdma_data is insufficient to contain the data
represented by the property-associated typedef.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
A receiver does not report an error if it does not recognize
the value contained in rdma_which.
In that case, the receiver does not process that rpcrdma2_propval.
Processing continues with the next rpcrdma2_propval, if any.
</t>
<t>
The rpcrdma2_propset type specifies a set of transport properties.
The protocol does not impose a particular ordering of the rpcrdma2_propval items within it.
</t>
<t>
The rpcrdma2_propsubset type identifies
a subset of the properties in a rpcrdma2_propset.
Each bit in the mask denotes a particular element in a previously
specified rpcrdma2_propset.
If a particular rpcrdma2_propval is at position N in the array,
then bit number N mod 32 in word N div 32 specifies whether
the defined subset includes that particular rpcrdma2_propval.
Words beyond the last one specified are assumed to contain zero.

Most RPC-over-RDMA version 2 data structures have antecedents in

RPC-over-RDMA version 2's use of these first four words
aligns with that of version 1 as required by
<xref target="RFC8166" section="4.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
However, there are crucial structural differences
in the XDR definition of RPC-over-RDMA version 2:
in the way that these words are described
by the respective XDR descriptions:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The header type is represented as a uint32 rather than as an enum type.
An enum would need to be modified to reflect additions to the set of
header types made by later extensions.
</li>
<li>
The header type field is part of an XDR structure devoted to
representing the transport header prefix,
rather than being part of a discriminated union,
that includes the body of each transport header type.
</li>
<li>
There is now a prefix structure
(see
<xref target="section_2d1735f0-c465-43c6-9c18-3da6b7979862" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>)
of which the rpcrdma_common structure is the initial segment.
This prefix is a newly defined XDR object within the protocol description,
which constrains the universal portion of all header types
to the four words in rpcrdma_common.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
These changes are part of a more considerable structural change
in the XDR definition of RPC-over-RDMA version 2
that facilitates a cleaner treatment of protocol extension.
The XDR appearing in
<xref target="section_bf53e759-d97f-487d-a5e2-9b8153db1803" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
reflects these changes, which
<xref target="section_d945b9f0-0666-4db7-9126-be57cf7b5f4f" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>

<name>Payload Formats</name>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides several ways,
known as "payload formats",
to convey an RPC-over-RDMA message.
A sender chooses the payload format for each message
based on several factors:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The existence of DDP-eligible data items in the RPC message payload
</li>
<li>
The size of the RPC message payload

</li>
<li>
The available hardware resources
</li>
<li>
The arrangement of source and sink memory buffers
</li>
</ul>

The following subsections describe in detail how
Requesters and Responders
format RPC-over-RDMA message payloads.

<t>
All RPC messages conveyed via RPC-over-RDMA version 2
need at least one RDMA Send operation to convey.
Thus, the most efficient way to send an RPC message
that is smaller than the inline threshold
is to append the Payload stream directly to the Transport stream
and use an RDMA Send to convey both.
When no chunks are present, senders construct Calls and Replies the same way,
and no other operations are needed.

<t>
Even after DDP-eligible data items have been removed,
a Payload stream can sometimes be too large
to send using only RDMA Send operations.
In those cases, the sender can use RDMA Read or Write operations
to convey the entire RPC message.
We refer to this as a "Special Format" message.
</t>
<t>
To transmit a Special Format message,
the sender transmits only the Transport stream
with an RDMA Send operation.
The sender does not include the Payload stream in the send buffer.
Instead, the Requester provides a body chunk that the Responder
uses to move the Payload stream.
</t>
<t>
Because chunks are always present in Special Format messages,
the sender always handles Calls and Replies differently.
</t>
<dl newline="true" spacing="normal">
<dt>Special Call</dt>
<dd>
The Requester provides a Read chunk
that contains the RPC Call message's Payload stream.
Every Read segment in this chunk
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
contain zero (0) in its Position field.
This type of Read chunk is a body chunk known as a Call chunk.
</dd>
<dt>Special Reply</dt>
<dd>
The Requester provisions a Reply chunk in advance.
This body chunk is a Write chunk into which
the Responder places the RPC Reply message's Payload stream.
The Requester provisions the Reply chunk to accommodate
the maximum expected reply size for that upper-layer operation.
</dd>
</dl>
<t>
One purpose of a Special Format message is to handle large RPC messages.
However, Requesters
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
use a Special Format message at any time to convey an RPC Call message.
</t>
<t>
When it has alternatives,
a Responder chooses which Format to use based on the chunks
provided by the Requester.
If a Requester provided a Write chunk
and
the Responder has a DDP-eligible result,
it first reduces the reply Payload stream.
If a Requester provided a Reply chunk
and
the reduced Payload stream is larger than the reply inline threshold,
the Responder
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>
use the Requester-provided Reply chunk for the reply.

<name>Choosing a Reply Payload Format</name>
<t>
A Requester provisions all necessary registered memory resources
for both an RPC Call and its matching RPC Reply.
A Requester constructs each RPC Call, thus it can compute
the exact memory resources needed to send every Call.
However, the Requester allocates memory resources
to receive the corresponding Reply before the Responder has constructed it.
Occasionally, it is challenging for the Requester
to know in advance precisely what resources are needed to receive the Reply.
</t>
<t>
In RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
a Requester can provide a Reply chunk for any transaction.
The Responder can use the provided Reply chunk
or
it can decide to use another means to convey the RPC Reply.
If
the combination of the provided Write chunk list
and
Reply chunk
is not adequate to convey a Reply,
the Responder <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use Message Continuation
to send that Reply.
If even that is not possible,
the Responder sends an RDMA2_ERROR message to the Requester,
as described in
<xref target="section_b1d23e5c-31df-483f-adb7-25430b5de38d" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
If the Write chunk list cannot accommodate the ULP's DDP-eligible data payload,
the Responder sends an RDMA2_ERR_WRITE_RESOURCE error.
</li>
<li>
If the Reply chunk cannot accommodate the parts of the Reply that are not DDP-eligible,
the Responder sends an RDMA2_ERR_REPLY_RESOURCE error.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
When receiving such errors,
the Requester can retry the ULP call using more substantial reply resources.
In cases where retrying the ULP request is not possible
(e.g., the request is non-idempotent),
the Requester terminates the RPC transaction
and presents an error to the RPC consumer.

<name>Error Handling</name>
<t>
A receiver performs validity checks
on each ingress RPC-over-RDMA message
before it assembles that message's Payload stream
and
passes it to the RPC layer.
For example, if an ingress RPC-over-RDMA message is not as long as
the size of struct rpcrdma2_hdr_prefix (20 octets),
the receiver cannot trust the value of the rdma_xid field.
In this case, the receiver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> silently discard the ingress message
without processing it further, and without a response to the sender.
</t>
<t>
When a request
(for instance, an RPC Call or a control plane operation)
is made,
typically an RPC consumer blocks while waiting for the response.
Thus when an incoming message conveys a request
and that request cannot be acted upon,
the receiver of that request needs
to report the problem to its sender
in order to unblock waiters.
Likewise, if, after processing a request,
a sender is unable to transmit the response
on an otherwise healthy connection,
the sender needs to report that problem
for the same reason.
</t>
<t>
The RDMA2_ERROR header type is used for this purpose.
To form an RDMA2_ERROR type header:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The rdma_xid field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the same XID
that was in the rdma_xid field in the ingress request.
</li>
<li>
The rdma_vers field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the same version
that was in the rdma_vers field in the ingress request.
</li>
<li>
The sender sets the rdma_credit field to the credit values in effect
for this connection.
</li>
<li>
The rdma_htype field <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the value RDMA2_ERROR.
</li>
<li>
The rdma_err field contains a value
that reflects the type of error that occurred,
as described in the subsections below.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
When a peer receives an RDMA2_ERROR message type
with an unrecognized or unsupported value in its rdma_err field,
it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> silently discard the message without processing it further.

This type of parsing failure might be due to mismatches

<name>Responder RDMA Operational Errors</name>
<t>
In RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
the Responder initiates RDMA Read and Write operations
that target the Requester's memory.
Problems might arise as the Responder attempts
to use Requester-provided resources for RDMA operations.
For example:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
Usually, chunks can be validated only by using their contents to perform data transfers.
If chunk contents are invalid
(e.g., a memory region is no longer registered
or
a chunk length exceeds the end of the registered memory region),
a Remote Access Error occurs.
</li>
<li>If a Requester's Receive buffer is too small,
the Responder's Send operation completes with a Local Length Error.
</li>
<li>
If the Requester-provided Reply chunk is too small
to accommodate a large RPC Reply message,
a Remote Access Error occurs.
A Responder might detect this problem before attempting to write past the end of the Reply chunk.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
RDMA operational errors can be fatal to the connection.
To avoid a retransmission loop and repeated connection loss that deadlocks the connection,
once the Requester has re-established a connection,
the Responder
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>
send an RDMA2_ERROR response
to indicate that no RPC-level reply is possible for that transaction.

<name>Extraction of the XDR Definition</name>

Implementers can apply the following sed script
to the current document to produce
a machine-readable XDR description
of the base RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol.

<sourcecode name="" type="" markers="true">

That is, if this document is in a file called "spec.txt",
then implementers can do the following
to extract an XDR description file
and store it in the file rpcrdma-v2.x.
</t>
<sourcecode name="" type="" markers="true">

]]>
</sourcecode>
<t>
Although this file is a usable description of the base protocol,
when extensions are to be supported,
it may be desirable to divide the description into multiple files.
The following script achieves that purpose:
</t>
<sourcecode name="" type="perl" markers="true">
<![CDATA[
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
open(IN,"rpcrdma-v2.x");
open(OUT,">temp.x");
while(<IN>)
{
  if (m/FILE ENDS: (.*)$/)
    {
      close(OUT);
      rename("temp.x", $1);
      open(OUT,">temp.x");
    }
    else
    {
      print OUT $_;
    }
}
close(IN);
close(OUT);
]]>
</sourcecode>
<t>
Running the above script results in two files:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The file common.x, containing the license
plus the shared XDR definitions
that need to be made available
to both the base protocol and any subsequent extensions.
</li>
<li>
The file baseops.x containing the XDR definitions
for the base protocol defined in this document.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
Extensions to RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
published as Standards Track documents,
should have similarly structured XDR definitions.
Once an implementer has extracted
the XDR for all desired extensions
and
the base XDR definition contained in the current document,
she can concatenate them to produce
a consolidated XDR definition
that reflects the set of extensions
selected for her RPC-over-RDMA version 2 implementation.
</t>
<t>
Alternatively, the XDR descriptions can be compiled separately.
In that case, the combination of common.x and baseops.x
defines the base transport.
The combination of common.x and the XDR description
of each extension produces a full XDR definition of that extension.

<name>Use of the XDR Description</name>
<t>
The files common.x and baseops.x,
when combined with the XDR descriptions for extension defined later,
produce a human-readable and compilable description
of the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol with the included extensions.
</t>
<t>
Although this XDR description can generate encoders and decoders
for the Transport and Payload streams,
there are elements of the operation of RPC-over-RDMA version 2
that cannot be expressed within the XDR language.
Implementations that use the output of an automated XDR processor
need to provide additional code to bridge these gaps.
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The Transport stream is not a single XDR object.
Instead, the header prefix is one XDR data item,
and the rest of the header is a separate XDR data item.
<xref target="table_b5c31bf9-d623-4957-97db-29fc1d416cb8" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
expresses the mapping between the header type in the header prefix
and
the XDR object representing the header type.
</li>
<li>
The relationship between
the Transport stream
and
the Payload stream
is not specified using XDR.
Comments within the XDR text
make clear where transported messages,
described by their own XDR definitions,
need to appear.
Such data is opaque to the transport.
</li>
<li>
Continuation of RPC messages across transport message boundaries
requires that message assembly facilities
not specifiable within XDR are part of transport implementations.
</li>
<li>
Transport properties are constant integer values.
<xref target="table_99d0e7cc-da81-4f16-9bd0-471f806bc0b6" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
expresses the mapping between
each property's code point
and
the XDR typedef that represents the structure of the property's value.
XDR does not possess the facility to express that mapping in an extensible way.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
The role of XDR in RPC-over-RDMA specifications
is more limited than for protocols
where the totality of the protocol is expressible within XDR.
XDR lacks the facility to represent
the embedding of XDR-encoded payload material.
Also, the need to cleanly accommodate extensions
has meant that those using rpcgen in their applications
need to take an active role to provide
the facilities that cannot be expressed within XDR.

<name>RPC Bind Parameters</name>
<t>
Before establishing a new connection,
an RPC client obtains a transport address for the RPC server.
The means used to obtain this address
and to open an RDMA connection is dependent
on the type of RDMA transport
and is the responsibility of each RPC protocol binding
and its local implementation.
</t>
<t>
RPC services typically register with a portmap or rpcbind service
<xref target="RFC1833" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
which associates an RPC Program number with a service address.
This policy is no different with RDMA transports.
However, a distinct service address (port number)
is sometimes required for operation on RPC-over-RDMA.
</t>
<t>
When mapped atop MPA
<xref target="RFC5044" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
which uses IP port addressing due to its layering on TCP or SCTP,
port mapping is trivial
and consists merely of issuing the port in the connection process.
The NFS/RDMA protocol service address
has been assigned port 20049 by IANA
for this deployment scenario
<xref target="RFC8267" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</t>
<t>
When mapped atop InfiniBand
<xref target="IBA" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
which uses a service endpoint naming scheme based on a Group Identifier (GID),
a translation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be employed.
One such translation is described in
Annexes A3 (Application Specific Identifiers),
A4 (Sockets Direct Protocol (SDP)),
and A11 (RDMA IP CM Service) of
<xref target="IBA" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
which is appropriate for translating IP port addressing
to the InfiniBand network.
Therefore, in this case,
IP port addressing may be readily employed by the upper layer.
</t>
<t>
When a mapping standard or convention exists
for IP ports on an RDMA interconnect,
there are several possibilities for each upper layer to consider:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
One possibility is to have the server register
its mapped IP port with the rpcbind service
under the netid (or netids) defined in
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
An RPC-over-RDMA-aware RPC client can then
resolve its desired service to a mappable port
and
proceed to connect.
This method is the most flexible and compatible approach
for those upper layers that are defined to use the rpcbind service.
</li>
<li>
A second possibility is to have the RPC server's portmapper
register itself on the RDMA interconnect at a "well-known" service address
(on UDP or TCP, this corresponds to port 111).
An RPC client can connect to this service address
and
use the portmap protocol to obtain a service address
in response to a program number
(e.g., a TCP port number or an InfiniBand GID).
</li>
<li>
Alternately, an RPC client can connect
to the mapped well-known port for the service itself,
if it is appropriately defined.
By convention, the NFS/RDMA service,
when operating atop an InfiniBand fabric,
uses the same 20049 assignment as for MPA.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
Historically, different RPC protocols have taken different approaches
to their port assignments.
The current document leaves the specific method for each RPC-over-RDMA-enabled ULB.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
defines two new netid values
to be used for registration of upper layers atop MPA
and (when a suitable port translation service is available) InfiniBand.
Additional RDMA-capable networks
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
define their own netids, or if they provide a port translation, they
<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>
share the one defined in
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.

The use of a Protection Domain to limit the exposure of memory regions

<t>
Implementations should use unpredictable memory handles
for any operation requiring exposed memory regions.
Exposing a continuously registered memory region
allows a remote host to read or write to that region
even when an RPC involving that memory is not underway.
Therefore, implementations should avoid
the use of persistently registered memory.

Requesters should register memory regions for remote access

Requesters should invalidate memory regions
as soon as related RPC operations are complete.
Invalidation and DMA unmapping of memory regions should complete

An RPC transaction on a Requester can terminate

<name>Denial of Service</name>
<t>
A detailed discussion of denial-of-service exposures
that can result from the use of an RDMA transport
appears in
<xref target="RFC5042" section="6.4" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</t>
<t>
A Responder is not obliged to pull unreasonably large Read chunks.
A Responder can use an RDMA2_ERROR response
to terminate RPCs with unreadable Read chunks.
If a Responder transmits more data than
a Requester is prepared to receive in a Write or Reply chunk,
the RDMA provider typically terminates the connection.
For further discussion, see
<xref target="section_b1d23e5c-31df-483f-adb7-25430b5de38d" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
Such repeated connection termination can deny service
to other users sharing the connection from the errant Requester.
</t>
<t>
An RPC-over-RDMA transport implementation is not responsible
for throttling the RPC request rate,
other than to keep the number of concurrent RPC transactions
at or under the number of credits granted per connection (see
<xref target="section_45c67eb8-8dc6-47c3-8555-14270f1514bF" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>).
A sender can trigger a self-denial of service
by exceeding the credit grant repeatedly.
</t>
<t>
When an RPC transaction terminates due to
a signal
or
premature exit of an application process,
a Requester should invalidate the RPC's Write and Reply chunks.
Invalidation prevents the subsequent arrival of the Responder's Reply
from altering the memory regions associated with those chunks
after the Requester has released that memory.
</t>
<t>
On the Requester,
a malfunctioning application
or
a malicious user
can create a situation where RPCs initiate and abort continuously,
resulting in Responder replies that terminate
the underlying RPC-over-RDMA connection repeatedly.
Such situations can deny service to other users
sharing the connection from that Requester.

per-message integrity checking (rpc_gss_svc_integrity),
and
per-message confidentiality (rpc_gss_svc_privacy)
in a layer above the RPC-over-RDMA transport.
The integrity and privacy services require
significant computation and movement of data
on each endpoint host.
Some performance benefits enabled by RDMA transports can be lost.

<name>RPC-over-RDMA Protection at Other Layers</name>
<t>
For any RPC transport,
utilizing RPCSEC_GSS integrity or privacy services
has performance implications.
Protection below the RPC implementation is often
a better choice in performance-sensitive deployments,
especially if it, too, can be offloaded.
Certain implementations of IPsec can be co-located in RDMA hardware,
for example,
without change to RDMA consumers
and
with little loss of data movement efficiency.
Such arrangements can also provide a higher degree of privacy
by hiding endpoint identity
or
altering the frequency at which messages are exchanged,
at a performance cost.
</t>
<t>
Implementations <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> negotiate the use of protection

<name>RPCSEC_GSS on RPC-over-RDMA Transports</name>
<t>
Not all RDMA devices and fabrics support the above protection mechanisms.
Also, NFS clients, where multiple users can access NFS files,
still require per-message authentication.
In these cases, RPCSEC_GSS can protect NFS traffic conveyed on RPC-over-RDMA connections.
</t>
<t>
RPCSEC_GSS extends the ONC RPC protocol without changing the format of RPC messages.
By observing the conventions described in this section,
an RPC-over-RDMA transport can convey RPCSEC_GSS-protected RPC messages interoperably.
</t>
<t>
Senders <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reduce protocol elements of RPCSEC_GSS

<name>RPC-over-RDMA with RPCSEC_GSS Authentication</name>
<t>
The RPCSEC_GSS authentication service has no impact
on the DDP-eligibility of data items in a ULP.
</t>
<t>
However, RPCSEC_GSS authentication material
appearing in an RPC message header can be larger than, say,
an AUTH_SYS authenticator.
In particular, when an RPCSEC_GSS pseudoflavor is in use,
a Requester needs to accommodate a larger RPC credential
when marshaling RPC Calls
and
needs to provide for a maximum size RPCSEC_GSS verifier
when allocating reply buffers and Reply chunks.
</t>
<t>
RPC messages, and thus Payload streams,
are larger on average as a result.
ULP operations that fit in a Simple Format message
when a simpler form of authentication is in use
might need to be reduced or conveyed via a Special Format message
when RPCSEC_GSS authentication is in use.
It is therefore more likely that a Requester provisions
both a Read list and a Reply chunk
in the same RPC-over-RDMA Transport header
to convey a Special Format Call
and provision a receptacle for a Special Format Reply.
</t>
<t>
In addition to this cost,
the XDR encoding and decoding of each RPC message
using RPCSEC_GSS authentication
requires per-message host compute resources
to construct the GSS verifier.
</t>

<name>RPC-over-RDMA with RPCSEC_GSS Integrity or Privacy</name>
<t>
The RPCSEC_GSS integrity service enables endpoints
to detect the modification of RPC messages in flight.
The RPCSEC_GSS privacy service prevents
all but the intended recipient
from viewing the cleartext content of RPC arguments and results.
RPCSEC_GSS integrity and privacy services are end-to-end.
They protect RPC arguments and results from application to server endpoint, and back.
</t>
<t>
The RPCSEC_GSS integrity and encryption services operate
on whole RPC messages after they have been XDR encoded,
and before they have been XDR decoded after receipt.
Connection endpoints use intermediate buffers
to prevent exposure of encrypted
or
unverified cleartext data to RPC consumers.
After a sender has
verified,
encrypted,
and
wrapped a message,
the transport layer <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> use RDMA data transfer
between these intermediate buffers.
</t>
<t>
The process of reducing a DDP-eligible data item removes
the data item
and
its XDR padding
from an encoded Payload stream.
In a non-protected RPC-over-RDMA message,
a reduced data item does not include XDR padding.
After reduction, the Payload stream contains fewer octets
than the whole XDR stream did beforehand.
XDR padding octets are often zero bytes, but they don't have to be.
Thus, reducing DDP-eligible items affects
the result of message integrity verification and encryption.
</t>
<t>
Therefore, a sender <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> reduce a Payload stream
when RPCSEC_GSS integrity or encryption services are in use.
Effectively, no data item is DDP-eligible in this situation.
Senders can use only Simple and Continued Formats without data item chunks,
or Special Format.
In this mode, an RPC-over-RDMA transport operates
in the same manner as a transport that does not support DDP.

<name>Protecting RPC-over-RDMA Transport Headers</name>
<t>
Like the header fields in an RPC message
(e.g., the xid and mtype fields),
RPCSEC_GSS does not protect the RPC-over-RDMA Transport stream.
XIDs, connection credit limits, and chunk lists
(though not the content of the data items they refer to)
are exposed to malicious behavior,
which can redirect data that is transferred by the RPC-over-RDMA message,
result in spurious retransmits,
or
trigger connection loss.
</t>
<t>
In particular,
if an attacker alters the information
contained in the chunk lists of an RPC-over-RDMA Transport header,
data contained in those chunks can be redirected
to other registered memory regions on Requesters.
An attacker might alter the arguments
of RDMA Read and RDMA Write operations on the wire
to gain a similar effect.
If such alterations occur,
the use of RPCSEC_GSS integrity or privacy services
enables a Requester to detect unexpected material in a received RPC message.

<t>
Encryption at other layers, as described in
<xref target="section_ca56ff24-b218-455a-9faf-c8f7c17bf26c" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,

<name>DDP-Eligibility</name>
<t>
A ULB designates specific XDR data items as eligible for DDP.
As a sender constructs an RPC-over-RDMA message,
it can remove DDP-eligible data items from the Payload stream
so that the RDMA provider can place them
directly in the receiver's memory.
An XDR data item should be considered for DDP-eligibility
if there is a clear benefit to moving the contents
of the item directly from the sender's memory
to the receiver's memory.
</t>
<t>
Criteria for DDP-eligibility include:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The XDR data item is frequently sent or received, and its size is
often much larger than typical inline thresholds.
</li>
<li>
If the XDR data item is a result, its maximum size must be
predictable in advance by the Requester.
</li>
<li>
Transport-level processing of the XDR data item is not needed.
For example, the data item is an opaque byte array, which requires
no XDR encoding and decoding of its content.
</li>
<li>
The content of the XDR data item is sensitive to address alignment.
For example, a data copy operation would be required
on the receiver to enable the message to be parsed correctly,
or
to enable the data item to be accessed.
</li>
<li>
The XDR data item itself does not contain DDP-eligible data items.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
In addition to defining the set of data items that are DDP-eligible,
a ULB may limit the use of chunks
to particular upper-layer procedures.
If more than one data item in a procedure is DDP-eligible,
the ULB may limit the number of chunks
that a Requester can provide for a particular upper-layer procedure.
</t>
<t>
Senders never reduce data items that are not DDP-eligible.
Such data items can, however, be part of a Special Format payload.
</t>
<t>
The programming interface by which an upper-layer implementation
indicates the DDP-eligibility of a data item to the RPC transport
is not described by this specification.
The only requirements are
that the receiver can re-assemble
the transmitted RPC-over-RDMA message into a valid XDR stream
and
that DDP-eligibility rules specified by the ULB are respected.
</t>
<t>
There is no provision to express DDP-eligibility within the XDR
language.
The only definitive specification of DDP-eligibility is a ULB.
</t>
<t>
In general, a DDP-eligibility violation occurs when:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
A Requester reduces a non-DDP-eligible argument data item.
The Responder reports the violation as described in
<xref target="section_b1d23e5c-31df-483f-adb7-25430b5de38d" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</li>
<li>
A Responder reduces a non-DDP-eligible result data item.
The Requester terminates the pending RPC transaction
and reports an appropriate permanent error to the RPC consumer.

an available Write chunk.
The Requester terminates the pending RPC transaction

<name>Extending RPC-over-RDMA Version 2</name>
<t>
This Appendix is not addressed to protocol implementers,
but rather to authors of documents that
extend the protocol specified in the current document.
</t>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 extensibility facilitates
limited extensions to the base protocol
presented in the current document
so that new optional capabilities can be introduced
without a protocol version change
while maintaining robust interoperability
with existing RPC-over-RDMA version 2 implementations.
It allows extensions to be defined,
including the definition of new protocol elements,
without requiring modification or recompilation
of the XDR for the base protocol.
</t>
<t>
Standards Track documents may introduce extensions
to the base RPC-over-RDMA version 2 protocol in two ways:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
They may introduce new <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> transport header types.
<xref target="section_d4650151-40f0-4e85-8755-02c38cf8f444" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
covers such transport header types.
</li>
<li>
They may define new <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> transport properties.
<xref target="section_a355adad-f03b-41a6-94a8-4128b10301bb" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
describes such transport properties.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
These documents may also add the following sorts
of ancillary protocol elements to the protocol
to support the addition of
new transport properties and header types:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
They may create new error codes, as described in
<xref target="section_c2f5e937-d612-4e3a-a380-e0b15261f6a0" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
New capabilities can be
proposed
and
developed
independently of each other.
Implementers can choose among them,
making it straightforward
to create
and
document
experimental features
and then bring them through the standards process.

<name>Documentation Requirements</name>
<t>
As described earlier,
a Standards Track document introduces a set of new protocol elements.
Together these elements are considered an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> feature.
Each implementation is either
aware of all the protocol elements introduced by that feature
or
is aware of none of them.
</t>
<t>
Documents specifying extensions to RPC-over-RDMA version 2 should contain:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
An explanation of the purpose and use of each new protocol element.
</li>
<li>
An XDR description including all of the new protocol elements,
and a script to extract it.
</li>
<li>
A discussion of interactions with other extensions.
This discussion includes
requirements for other <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> features to be present,
or
that a particular level of support for an <bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14> facility is required.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
Implementers combine the XDR descriptions
of the new features they intend to use
with
the XDR description of the base protocol in the current document.
This combination is necessary to create a valid XDR input file
because extensions are
free to use XDR types defined in the base protocol,
and
later extensions may use types defined by earlier extensions.
</t>
<t>
The XDR description for the RPC-over-RDMA version 2 base protocol
combined with that for any selected extensions
should provide a human-readable and compilable definition
of the extended protocol.

<name>Changes to the XDR Definition</name>
<t>
Several XDR structural changes enable
within-version protocol extensibility.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
defines the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport header
as a single XDR object,
with an RPC message potentially following it.
In RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
there are separate XDR definitions of the transport header prefix (see
<xref target="section_2d1735f0-c465-43c6-9c18-3da6b7979862" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>),
which specifies the transport header type to be used,
and the transport header itself
(defined within one of the subsections of
<xref target="section_8039c7b8-9068-401e-9cbd-5c1e67d403e7" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>).
This construction is similar to an RPC message,
which consists of an RPC header (defined in
<xref target="RFC5531" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>)
followed by a message defined by an Upper-Layer Protocol.
</t>
<t>
As a new version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 exists within the versioning rules defined in
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
In particular, it maintains the first four words of the protocol header,
as specified in
<xref target="RFC8166" section="4.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
even though, as explained in
<xref target="section_e21d4f74-b536-47f2-9d07-c03a27a20de4" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
of the current document,
the XDR definition of those words is structured differently.
</t>
<t>
Although each of the first four fields retains its semantic function,
there are differences in interpretation:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The first word of the header, the rdma_xid field,
retains the format and function that it had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
Because RPC-over-RDMA version 2 messages can convey non-RPC messages,
a receiver should not use the contents of this field
without consideration of the protocol version and header type.
</li>
<li>
The second word of the header, the rdma_vers field,
retains the format and function that it had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
To clearly distinguish version 1 and version 2 messages,
senders need to fill in the correct version
(fixed after version negotiation).
Receivers should check that the content of the rdma_vers is correct
before using the content of any other header field.
</li>
<li>
The third word of the header, the rdma_credit field,
retains the size and general purpose that it had in RPC-over-RDMA version 1.
However, RPC-over-RDMA version 2 divides this field
into two 16-bit subfields. See
<xref target="section_45c67eb8-8dc6-47c3-8555-14270f1514bF" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
for further details.
</li>
<li>
The fourth word of the header,
previously the union discriminator field rdma_proc,
retains its format and general function
even though the set of valid values has changed.
Within RPC-over-RDMA version 2,
this word is the rdma_htype field of the structure rdma_start.
The value of this field is now an unsigned 32-bit integer
rather than an enum type, to facilitate header type extension.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
Beyond conforming to the restrictions specified in
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 attempts to limit
the scope of the changes made to ensure interoperability.
Although it introduces the Call chunk
and splits the two version 1 workhorse procedure types
RDMA_MSG and RDMA_NOMSG into several variants,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 otherwise
expresses chunks in the same format and utilizes them the same way.

RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides a mechanism
for exchanging an implementation's operational properties.
The purpose of this exchange is to help endpoints
improve the efficiency of data transfer
by exploiting the characteristics of both peers
rather than falling back on
the lowest common denominator default settings.

<name>Credit Management Changes</name>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA transports employ credit-based flow control
to ensure that a Requester does not emit more RDMA Sends
than the Responder is prepared to receive.
</t>
<t>
<xref target="RFC8166" section="3.3.1" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
explains the operation of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 credit management
in detail.
In that design, each RDMA Send from a Requester
contains an RPC Call with a credit request,
and each RDMA Send from a Responder contains an RPC Reply
with a credit grant.
The credit grant implies that enough Receives
have been posted on the Responder to handle the credit grant
minus the number of pending RPC transactions
(the number of remaining Receive buffers might be zero).
</t>
<t>
Each RPC Reply acts as an implicit ACK
for a previous RPC Call from the Requester.
Without an RPC Reply message,
the Requester has no way to know that
the Responder is ready for subsequent RPC Calls.
</t>
<t>
Because version 1 embeds credit management in each message,
there is a strict one-to-one ratio between RDMA Send and RPC message.
There are interesting use cases that might be enabled
if this relationship were more flexible:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
RPC-over-RDMA operations that do not carry an RPC message,
e.g., control plane operations.
</li>
<li>
A single RDMA Send that conveys more than one RPC message,
e.g., for interrupt mitigation.
</li>
<li>
An RPC message that requires several sequential RDMA Sends,
e.g., to reduce the use of explicit RDMA operations for moderate-sized RPC messages.
</li>
<li>
An RPC transaction that requires multiple exchanges
or
an odd number of RPC-over-RDMA operations to complete.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides
a more sophisticated credit accounting mechanism
to address these shortcomings.

<name>Inline Threshold Changes</name>
<t>
An "inline threshold" value is the largest message size (in octets)
that can be conveyed on an RDMA connection
using only RDMA Send and Receive.
Each connection has two inline threshold values:
one for messages flowing from client-to-server
(referred to as the "client-to-server inline threshold")
and one for messages flowing from server-to-client
(referred to as the "server-to-client inline threshold").
</t>
<t>
A connection's inline thresholds determine,
among other things,
when RDMA Read or Write operations are required
because an RPC message cannot be conveyed via a single RDMA Send and Receive pair.
When an RPC message does not contain DDP-eligible data items,
a Requester can prepare a Special Format Call or Reply
to convey the whole RPC message using RDMA Read or Write operations.
</t>
<t>
RDMA Read and Write operations require that data payloads
reside in memory registered with the local RNIC.
When an RPC completes,
that memory is invalidated to fence it from the Responder.
Memory registration and invalidation typically have a latency cost
that is insignificant compared to data handling costs.
</t>
<t>
When a data payload is small, however,
the cost of registering and invalidating
memory where the payload resides
becomes a significant part of total RPC latency.
Therefore the most efficient operation of an RPC-over-RDMA transport
occurs when the peers use explicit RDMA Read and Write operations
for large payloads but avoid those operations for small payloads.
</t>
<t>
When the authors of
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
first conceived RPC-over-RDMA version 1,
the average size of RPC messages
that did not involve a significant data payload
was under 500 bytes.
A 1024-byte inline threshold adequately minimized
the frequency of inefficient Long messages.
</t>
<t>
With NFS version 4
<xref target="RFC7530" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>,
the increased size of NFS COMPOUND operations
resulted in RPC messages that are, on average,
larger than previous versions of NFS.
With a 1024-byte inline threshold,
frequent operations such as GETATTR and LOOKUP
require RDMA Read or Write operations,
reducing the efficiency of data transport.
</t>
<t>
To reduce the frequency of Special Format messages,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 increases the default size of inline thresholds.
This change also increases the maximum size
of reverse-direction RPC messages.

In addition to a larger default inline threshold,
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 introduces Message Continuation.
Message Continuation is a mechanism
that enables the transmission of a data payload

The purpose of Message Continuation is
to provide relief in several essential cases:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
If a Requester finds that it is inefficient

for a Responder to send an RPC Reply,
the Responder can use Message Continuation to send the RPC Reply.
</li>

(e.g., a large transport property),
the sender can use Message Continuation to avoid having to register memory.

<name>Host Authentication Changes</name>
<t>
For the general operation of NFS on open networks,
we eventually intend to rely on RPC-on-TLS
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rpc-tls" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
to provide cryptographic authentication of the two ends of each connection.
In turn, this can improve the trustworthiness of AUTH_SYS-style user identities
that flow on TCP, which are not cryptographically protected.
We do not have a similar solution for RPC-over-RDMA, however.

<name>Support for Remote Invalidation</name>
<t>
When an RDMA consumer uses FRWR or Memory Windows to register memory,
that memory may be invalidated remotely [RFC5040].
These mechanisms are available when
a Requester's RNIC supports MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS.
</t>
<t>
For this discussion, there are two classes of STags.
Dynamically-registered STags appear in a single RPC,
then are invalidated.
Persistently-registered STags survive longer than one RPC.
They may persist for the life of an RPC-over-RDMA connection
or even longer.
</t>
<t>
An RPC-over-RDMA Requester can provide
more than one STag in a transport header.
It may provide
a combination of dynamically- and persistently-registered STags in one RPC message,
or
any combination of these in a series of RPCs on the same connection.
Only dynamically-registered STags using Memory Windows or FRWR
may be invalidated remotely.
</t>
<t>
There is no transport-level mechanism
by which a Responder can determine
how a Requester-provided STag was registered,
nor whether it is eligible to be invalidated remotely.
A Requester that mixes persistently- and dynamically-registered STags in one RPC,
or mixes them across RPCs on the same connection,
must, therefore, indicate which STag the Responder may invalidate remotely
via a mechanism provided in the Upper-Layer Protocol.
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 provides such a mechanism.
</t>
<t>
A sender uses the RDMA Send With Invalidate operation
to invalidate an STag on the remote peer.
It is available only when both peers support MEM_MGT_EXTENSIONS
(can send and process an IETH).
</t>
<t>
Existing RPC-over-RDMA transport protocol specifications
<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
<xref target="RFC8167" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
do not forbid direct data placement in the reverse direction.
Moreover, there is currently no Upper-Layer Protocol
that makes data items in reverse-direction operations
eligible for direct data placement.
</t>
<t>
When chunks are present in a reverse-direction RPC request,
Remote Invalidation enables the Responder
to trigger invalidation of a Requester's STags
as part of sending an RPC Reply,
the same way as is done in the forward direction.
</t>
<t>
However, in the reverse direction, the server acts as the Requester,
and the client is the Responder.
The server's RNIC, therefore, must support receiving an IETH,
and the server must have registered its STags
with an appropriate registration mechanism.

<name>Integration of Reverse-Direction Operation</name>

Because

<xref target="RFC8166" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>
does not include it either.

<xref target="RFC8167" format="default" sectionFormat="of"/>.
</t>
<t>
Reverse-direction operation in RPC-over-RDMA version 1
was constrained by the limited ability to extend
that version of the protocol.
The most awkward issue is that
a receiver needs to peek at ingress RPC message payloads
to determine whether it is a Call or Reply message.
This is necessary because the meaning of several fields
in the RPC-over-RDMA transport header
is determined by the direction of the RPC message payload:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The meaning of the value in the rdma_xid field
is determined by the direction of the message because
the XID spaces in the forward and reverse directions are distinct.
</li>
<li>
The meaning of the value in the rdma_credits field
is determined by the direction of the message because
credits are granted separately
for forward and reverse direction operation.
</li>
<li>
The purpose of Write chunks and the meaning of their length fields
is determined by the direction of the message because
in Call messages, they are provisional,
but in Reply messages, they represent returned results.
</li>
</ul>
<t>
The current document remedies this awkwardness by
integrating reverse-direction operation
into RPC-over-RDMA version 2 so that it can
make use of all facilities that are available in the forward-direction,
including body chunks, remote invalidation, and message continuation.
To enable this integration,
the direction of the RPC message payload is encoded
in each RPC-over-RDMA version 2 transport header.

<name>Error Reporting Changes</name>
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA version 2 expands the repertoire of errors
that connection peers may report to each other.
The goals of this expansion are:
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
To fill in details of peer recovery actions.
</li>
<li>
To enable retrying certain conditions
caused by mis-estimation of the maximum reply size.
</li>
<li>
To minimize the likelihood of a Requester waiting forever for a Reply
when there are communications problems that prevent the Responder
from sending it.
</li>
</ul>

<name>Changes in Terminology</name>
<t>
The RPC-over-RDMA version 2 specification makes
the following changes in terminology.
These changes do not result in
changes in the behavior or operation of the protocol.
</t>
<ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false">
<li>
The current document explicitly acknowledges the different semantics
and purpose of Write chunks appearing in Call messages
and those appearing in Reply messages.
</li>
<li>
The current document introduces the term "payload format"
to describe the selection of a mechanism for reducing
and conveying an RPC message payload.
It replaces the terms "short message" and "long message"
with the terms "simple format" and "special format"
because this selection is not based only on
the size of the payload.
</li>
<li>
The current document introduces the terms
"data item chunk"
and
"body chunk"
in order to distinguish the purpose and operation
of these two categories of chunk.
</li>
<li>
For improved readability,
the current document replaces the terms
"RDMA segment"
and
"plain segment"
with the term "segment",
and the term
"RDMA read segment"
with the term "Read segment".
</li>
<li>
The current document refers specifically to
the RDMAP, DDP, and MPA standards track protocols
rather than using the nebulous term "iWARP".
</li>
</ul>
