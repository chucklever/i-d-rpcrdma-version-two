<abstract>
<t>
This document specifies an improved protocol for
conveying Remote Procedure Call (RPC) messages
on physical transports capable of
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA),
based on RPC-over-RDMA Version One.
</t>
</abstract>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)
<xref target="RFC5040"/> <xref target="RFC5041"/>
<xref target="IB"/> is a
technique for moving data efficiently between end nodes.
By directing data into destination buffers as it is sent
on a network, and placing it via direct memory access by
hardware, the complementary benefits of
faster transfers and reduced host overhead are obtained.
</t>
<t>
A protocol already exists that enables ONC RPC
<xref target="RFC5531"/> messages to be
conveyed on RDMA transports.
That protocol is RPC-over-RDMA Version One, specified in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis"/>.
RPC-over-RDMA Version One is deployed and in use,
though there are some shortcomings to this protocol,
such as:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
The use of small Receive buffers force the use of RDMA
Read and Write transfers for small payloads, and limit
the size of backchannel messages
</t>
<t>
Lack of support for potential optimizations, such as
remote invalidation, that require changes to on-the-wire
behavior
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
To address these issues in a way that is
compatible with existing RPC-over-RDMA Version One
deployments, a new version of RPC-over-RDMA is presented
in this document.
RPC-over-RDMA Version Two contains only incremental changes
over RPC-over-RDMA Version One to facilitate adoption of
Version Two by existing Version One implementations.
</t>
<t>
The major new feature in RPC-over-RDMA Version Two is
extensibility of the RPC-over-RDMA header.
Extensibility enables narrow changes to RPC-over-RDMA
Version Two so that new optional capabilities can be
introduced without a protocol version change and
while maintaining interoperability with existing
implementations.
New capabilities can be proposed and developed
independently of each other, and implementaters
can choose among them.
It should be straightforward to create and document
experimental features and then bring them through
the standards process.
</t>
<t>
In addition to extensibility, the default inline
threshold value is larger in RPC-over-RDMA Version Two.
This change is driven by the increase in average
size of RPC messages containing common NFS operations.
With NFSv4.1 <xref target="RFC5661"/> and later,
compound operations convey more data per RPC message.
The default 1KB inline threshold in RPC-over-RDMA
Version One prevents attaining the best possible
performance.
</t>

 anchor="requirements-language">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
"SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section
 title="Inline Threshold">

<section
 title="Terminology">
<t>
The term "inline threshold" is defined in Section 4 of
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis"/>.
An "inline threshold" value is the largest message size (in octets)
that can be conveyed in one direction between peer implementations
using RDMA Send and Receive.
Each connection has two inline threshold values: one for messages
flowing from requester-to-responder (referred to as the
"call inline threshold"),
and one for messages flowing from responder-to-requester
(referred to as the "reply inline threshold").
Inline threshold values are not advertised to peers via the base
RPC-over-RDMA Version Two protocol.
</t>
<t>
A connection's inline threshold determines when RDMA Read or
Write operations are required because the RPC message to be
sent cannot be conveyed via RDMA Send and Receive.
When an RPC message does not contain DDP-eligible data items,
a requester prepares a Long Call or Reply to convey the whole
RPC message using RDMA Read or Write operations.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Motivation">
<t>
RDMA Read and Write operations require that each data payload
resides in a region of memory that is registered with the RNIC.
When an RPC is complete, that region is unregistered, fencing it
from the responder.
</t>
<t>
Both registration and unregistration have a latency cost which is
insignificant compared to data handling costs.
When a data payload is small, however, the cost of registering and
unregistering the memory where the payload resides becomes
a relatively significant part of total RPC latency.
Therefore the most efficient operation of RPC-over-RDMA occurs
when RDMA Read and Write operations are used for large payloads,
and avoided for small payloads.
</t>
<t>
When RPC-over-RDMA Version One was conceived, the typical size
of RPC messages that did not involve a significant data payload
was under 500 bytes.
A 1024-byte inline threshold adequately minimized the frequency
of inefficient Long Calls and Replies.
</t>
<t>
Starting with NFSv4.1 <xref target="RFC5661"/>, NFS COMPOUND RPC
messages are larger and more complex than before.
With a 1024-byte inline threshold, RDMA Read or Write operations
are needed for frequent operations that do not bear a data payload,
such as GETATTR and LOOKUP, reducing the efficiency of the
transport.
To reduce the need to use Long Calls and Replies, RPC-over-RDMA
Version Two increases the default inline threshold size.
This also increases the maximum size of backward direction
RPC messages.
</t>
</section>

<section
 title="Default Values">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA Version Two receiver implementations MUST support
an inline threshold of 4096 bytes, but MAY support larger inline
threshold values.
A mechanism for discovering a peer's preferred inline threshold
value (not defined in this document) may be used to optimize
RDMA Send operations further.
In the absense of such a mechanism, senders MUST assume a receiver's
inline threshold is 4096 bytes.
</t>
<t>
The new default inline threshold size is no larger than the size
of a hardware page on typical platforms.
This conserves the resources needed to Send and Receive base
level RPC-over-RDMA Version Two messages, enabling RPC-over-RDMA
Version Two to be used on a broad variety of hardware.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section
 title="Protocol Extensibility"
 anchor="protocol-extensibility">

<t>
The core RPC-over-RDMA Version Two header format is specified
in <xref target="xdr-protocol-definition"/> as a complete and
stand-alone piece of XDR.
Any change to this XDR description requires a protocol
version number change.
</t>

<section
 title="Optional Features"
 anchor="optional-features">

<t>
RPC-over-RDMA Version Two introduces the ability to extend
the core protocol via optional features.
Extensibility enables minor protocol issues to be addressed
and incremental enhancements to be made without the need to
change the protocol version.
The key capability is that both sides can detect whether a
feature is supported by their peer or not.
With this ability, OPTIONAL features can be introduced over
time to an otherwise stable protocol.
</t>
<t>
The rdma_opttype field carries a 32-bit unsigned integer.
The value in this field denotes an optional operation
that MAY be supported by the receiver.
The values of this field and their meaning are defined in
other Standards Track documents.
</t>
<t>
The rdma_optinfo field carries opaque data.
The content of this field is data meaningful to the
optional operation denoted by the value in rdma_opttype.
The content of this field is not
defined in the base RPC-over-RDMA Version Two protocol,
but is defined in other Standards Track documents
</t>
<t>
When an implementation does not recognize or support the
value contained in the rdma_opttype field, it MUST send
an RPC-over-RDMA message with the rdma_xid field set
to the same value as the erroneous message, the rdma_proc
field set to RDMA2_ERROR, and the rdma_err field set to
RDMA2_ERR_INVAL_OPTION.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Message Direction">
<t>
Backward direction operation depends on the ability
of the receiver to distinguish between incoming
forward and backward direction calls and replies.
This needs to be done because both the XID field and
the flow control value (RPC-over-RDMA credits) in the
RPC-over-RDMA header are interpreted in the context
of each message's direction.
</t>
<t>
A receiver typically distinguishes message direction
by examining the mtype field in the RPC header of each
incoming payload message.
However, RDMA2_OPTIONAL type messages may not carry an
RPC message payload.
</t>
<t>
To enable RDMA2_OPTIONAL type messages that do not carry
an RPC message payload to be interpreted unambiguously,
the rdma2_optional structure contains a field that
identifies the message direction.
A similar field has been added to the rpcrdma2_chunk_lists
and rpcrdma2_error structures to simplify parsing the
RPC-over-RDMA header at the receiver.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Documentation Requirements">
<t>
RPC-over-RDMA Version Two may be extended by defining a new
rdma_opttype value, and then by providing an XDR description
of the rdma_optinfo content that corresponds with the new
rdma_opttype value.
As a result, a new header type is effectively created.
</t>
<t>
A Standards Track document introduces each set of such
protocol elements.
Together these elements are considered an OPTIONAL feature.
Each implementation is either aware of all the protocol
elements introduced by that feature, or is aware of none of
them.
</t>
<t>
Documents describing extensions to RPC-over-RDMA Version Two
should contain:
<list style="symbols">
<t>
An explanation of the purpose and use of each new protocol
element added
</t>
<t>
An XDR description of the protocol elements,
and a script to extract it
</t>
<t>
A mechanism for reporting errors when the error is
outside the available choices already available in the
base protocol or in other extensions
</t>
<t>
An indication of whether a Payload stream must be present,
and a description of its contents
</t>
<t>
A description of interactions with existing extensions
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
The last bullet includes requirements that another OPTIONAL
feature needs to be present for new protocol elements to work,
or that a particular level of support be provided for some
particular facility for the new extension to work.
</t>
<t>
Implementers combine the XDR descriptions of the new features
they intend to use with the XDR description of the base protocol
in this document.
This may be necessary to create a valid XDR input file because
extensions are free to use XDR types defined in the base
protocol, and later extensions may use types defined by earlier
extensions.
</t>
<t>
The XDR description for the RPC-over-RDMA Version Two protocol
combined with that for any selected extensions should provide
an adequate human-readable description of the extended protocol.
</t>
</section>

</section>

<section
 title="XDR Protocol Definition"
 anchor="xdr-protocol-definition">

<t>
This section contains a description of the core features of
the RPC-over-RDMA Version Two protocol, expressed in the XDR
language <xref target="RFC4506" />.
</t>
<t>
This description is provided in a way that makes it simple
to extract into ready-to-compile form.
The reader can apply the following shell script to this
document to produce a machine-readable XDR description of
the RPC-over-RDMA Version One protocol without any OPTIONAL
extensions.

#!/bin/sh
grep '^ *///' | sed 's?^ /// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'

<CODE ENDS>
]]>
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
That is, if the above script is stored in a file called
"extract.sh" and this document is in a file called
"spec.txt" then the reader can do the following to extract
an XDR description file:

<t>
Optional extensions to RPC-over-RDMA Version Two,
published as Standards Track documents,
will have similar means of providing XDR that describes
those extensions.
Once XDR for all desired extensions is also extracted,
it can be appended to the XDR description file extracted
from this document to produce a consolidated XDR description
file reflecting all extensions selected for an RPC-over-RDMA
implementation.

<section
 title="Protocol Version Negotiation">

<t>
When an RPC-over-RDMA Version Two requester establishes a
connection to a responder, the first order of business is to
determine the responder's highest supported protocol version.
</t>
<t>
As with RPC-over-RDMA Version One, a requester MUST assume the
ability to exchange only a single RPC-over-RDMA message at a
time until it receives a non-error RPC-over-RDMA message from
the responder that reports the responder's actual credit limit.
</t>
<t>
First, the requester sends a single valid RPC-over-RDMA message
with the value two (2) in the rdma_vers field.
Because the responder might support only RPC-over-RDMA
Version One, this initial message can be no larger than the
Version One default inline threshold of 1024 bytes.
</t>

<section
 title="Responder Does Support RPC-over-RDMA Version Two">

<t>
If the responder does support RPC-over-RDMA Version Two,
it sends an RPC-over-RDMA message back to the requester
with the same XID containing a valid non-error response.
Subsequently, both peers use the default inline threshold
value for RPC-over-RDMA Version Two connections (4096 bytes).
</t>

</section>

<section
 title="Responder Does Not Support RPC-over-RDMA Version Two">

<t>
If the responder does not support RPC-over-RDMA Version Two,
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc5666bis"/> REQUIRES that it
send an RPC-over-RDMA message to the requester with the same
XID, with RDMA2_ERROR in the rdma_proc field, and with the
error code RDMA2_ERR_VERS.
This message also reports a range of protocol versions that
the responder supports.
To continue operation, the requester selects a protocol
version in the range of responder-supported versions for
subsequent messages on this connection.
</t>
<t>
If the connection is lost immediately after the RDMA2_ERROR reply
is received, a requester can avoid a possible version negotiation
loop when re-establishing another connection by assuming that
particular responder does not support RPC-over-RDMA
Version Two.
A requester can assume the same situation (no responder support
for RPC-over-RDMA Version Two) if the initial negotiation message
is lost or dropped.
</t>
<t>
Once the negotiation exchange is complete, both peers use the
default inline threshold value for the protocol version that
will be used for the remainder of the connection lifetime.
To permit inline threshold values to change during negotiation
of protocol version, RPC-over-RDMA Version Two implementations
MUST allow inline threshold values to change without triggering
a connection loss.
